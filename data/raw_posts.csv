The incident occurred after the Chinese government abruptly announced a ban on Japanese artists performing in Chinaan announcement made while she was still singing.

This ban has led to the cancellation of numerous concerts by Japanese performers. The tension stems from China’s anger over comments made by the Japanese Prime Minister, who stated that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could prompt Japanese military involvement.

Adding further fuel to the situation, after Japanese media reported the story, a representative of the Chinese Embassy posted on X, declaring, “I’ll cut off the arrogant Japanese Prime Minister’s head.” The post quickly drew attention in Japan.

Afterward, the Chinese government reacted with outrage and demanded that the Japanese Prime Minister issue an apology even as the Chinese Embassy quietly acted as though the representative who made the threat had never existed.",1764489225.0,9814,605,https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/1pacpcp/a_japanese_anime_singer_maki_otsuki_was_abruptly/,https://v.redd.it/5yre099doc4g1,

Wild video shows the moment a disagreement between a driver and a pedestrian escalated into a full on roadside brawl after tempers boiled over.

The incident occurred around midday on Sunday in the popular beachside Sydney suburb of Coogee.

Bystander Steve said the two men were trading words for a few minutes before coming to blows.

**“The gentleman in the white shirt was crossing the road - it’s pretty busy there on Sundays in Coogee - the guy in the car kind of went before he’d walked across the road and they’ve exchanged words as you would,” he told news.com.au.**

“In other words, he just said, ‘oh, f\*\*k, come on, mate’.”

**Steve said the pedestrian approached the car window, and a passenger emerged from the car and got back in “about two or three times” before the scuffle broke out.**

**“It wasn’t until the guy (in the white shirt) told the lady (in the car) to go f\*\*k herself that old mate lost his s\*\*t,” he said.**

“He just ignited a fuse. He’s come roaring out of the car and chased him. It was mayhem,” Steve continued.

“I don’t think they really wanted to go at each other before that, he just f\*\*\*\*\*g lost his s\*\*t.”

The witness said traffic was held up “a good three to five minutes” before both men went on their way.

“I’d love to see them go toe-to-toe in the ring.

“The dog didn’t leave his side, that’s loyalty. Dogs are loyal, man.”

He went on to say such scenes weren’t uncommon in the area.

“You know what? It does happen there on Sundays because there are a lot of people who come in who don’t really know that you’ve got to give way to the pedestrians there,” he said.

Steve was with two young children at the time of the incident and said he had difficulty explaining the situation to them.

“I mean, there were young kids around there and I got two of my own, they were looking out the window at them, asking ‘why were they doing that?’” he said.

“You know, you’ve got to explain it to them. (One of the kids) wanted to re-enact it. It’s just like ‘no, mate’.”

Steve said he’d had words with the local council to ensure the incident didn’t occur again.

NSW Police said they had no information relating to the incident.

\--------

In terms of location, Coogee is not too far away from Bondi Beach, Australia (arguably nicer) and attracts many people to the beach from Sydney - particularly on weekends. It has expensive property prices c.A$4.3m (US$2.8m) for house / c.A$0.94m for unit/apartment).
