1p5sna8,TrueOffMyChest,,AdJust5162,"Feelings of extreme shame and guilt after a DUI, even 1,5 years later.","(Throwaway account, Flair just to be safe)

Hello. I've (21m) been wanting to write this post for some time, simply to express some of my frustrations to someone, even if it is just to random people on the internet.

About a year and a half ago I made the worst mistake of my life. I got behind the wheel of my car, knowing I had probably had one drink too many. The time leading up to the incident had been the worst period of my life. I was miserable. I felt very alone. I hated myself, my looks, my personality, you name it. It had been about a year since I finished school, and I was just spiraling. Even though on the outside, it might've looked like my life was great. I had an amazing job for a very young age (19 at the time). I had a very nice car, I was financially stable, everything was great. Except it just wasn't.

I, to this day, still don't know for sure why I was so down for so many months. One thing I do know is that I was likely very overworked. I was working about 50-60 hours a week, with an additional 10-12 hours driving to and from work. I was working a (high level for my age) management position for a big retail company in my country. Actually, I was working two management positions, since my supervisor was on maternity leave. This meant I handled the duties of 2 management positions, managing about 20 people at an age of 19-20. I am only writing about my work, because I simply do not know the reason for my misery at the time. I will say I was a little heartbroken at the time, but nothing I felt I couldn't handle. And as I mentioned, a lot of things were going ""well"" in my life. I know all this doesn't excuse my mistake, but this is the only logical explanation I have. I was drinking quite a lot at the time, I guess to escape from reality.

But then came that one night. I had been drinking, and I made the horrible decision to drive my car. Luckily, no one was hurt. I was parking my car when the police pulled me over. They had me blow into a breathalyzer, and then took me to the hospital to get a blood test, then to the police station. I was a mess. At least in my mind. I was pretty much dead on the outside, but my brain was screaming in disappointment. Somehow, the night it happened, my mom knew. I came home very tired, very defeated. She asked me: ""Is something wrong? Did something happen?"". She clearly knows me well. If nothing was wrong (or not wrong enough that I would wanna talk about it), I would've answered immediately, however, of course I would have to tell her about this. Before I could even speak, she asked: ""Did you drive? Did you get pulled over drunk?"". I have no idea how she knew. She didn't react well of course, but she also didn't scold me either. I guess she could tell I knew how stupid it was. Two months later, I got mail from the police, stating my BAC was just over the legal limit. In my country (for good reason) the laws on driving under the influence are quite strict. I had 14 days left to drive, before I would be banned from driving for 3 years. I also had to pay a fine of about 3000€. I was devastated. From the day it happened, I didn't eat, didn't sleep, didn't talk to my friends. The only reason I saw my friends for the two months waiting time was because one of my close friends was graduating. To this day, not even all of my family knows about it. I am simply too ashamed to tell them, and I know my grandma would kill me if she found out. I had to quit my job and find something else. Had to sell the car (which my parents were willing to buy, bless them). My entire life was pretty much crumbling before my eyes. Yet my parents were quick to help me. Figure out ways to make it work. I had given up on everything the day I received that letter. I was ready to end it. I felt like I lost everything with my drivers license. I lost my faith, masculinity, everything I had worked for. Although after about 4 weeks of feeling sorry for myself. I got back to work, and I was starting to get better. Somehow picking myself up, and trying to come to terms with my life.

This was the worst decision of my life. I am not the criminal type. I come from a good family, a good upbringing, and I have no one else to blame but myself. I live with this decision now. The thing I struggle with the most is the shame and the guilt. I will tell myself I deserve to feel this way, and I am constantly waiting for people to tell me this as well. However, somehow, this never happens. My closest friends laugh about it and make jokes (in good spirit, I am good with it). I was prepared to lose friends, because I thought people would think much worse about me. However, people are suspiciously nice about it. This is what I struggle with. I tell myself when I'm cycling to work in the pouring rain, that I deserve this. I did this to myself. I am pretty much the only person to shame myself over this, and I don't understand. 

When I lost my drivers license, I lost a lot of my confidence. Dating was completely off the table. I felt, and still feel, completely emasculated. Which I feel is stupid, but I feel it anyway. I am unable to take anyone on dates, pick people up, make plans etc. However, my experience with dating (since it kind of just happened inevitably), feels so weird. The girls I have dated have been good with it. They have even respected me for telling them (Thank you Cecilia). And I simply don't understand. In my eyes, my worth as a partner is lower because of my inability to drive, and also the fact that I have made that kind of mistake. Also, I am not just so hot that whatever crime I could have committed, doesn't even matter. I am an average dude. Even the girl I am dating now seems to have no problem with it, stating that I am not a burden at all, even when I feel like it because she has to drive us everywhere. I dread having to make plans with her, because I cannot take her anywhere. She has to drive. I have even sometimes insisted taking the bus or cycling to dates, even in the very cold winter. She calls me an idiot for it, insisting on picking me up, and I end up insisting to pay for gas and ""burdenmoney"". I feel like I can't be a proper boyfriend, and it is boring a hole in my brain, to the point where I am considering ending it, simply for this reason. Her parents also don't know, and they have apparently been asking her why I'm not picking her up, since somehow they know I used to drive. I don't know how I would go about telling them, and I am deathly afraid of telling them. Who would want their daughter to date some idiot who got a DUI?

I don't understand. I feel so much shame and guilt all the time. I dread having to tell people, yet their reaction is always surprisingly positive. Even when I told my old boss, he simply felt sorry for me, even making plans for how we would make it work with the bus times. It was just too far to make it work every day. I have felt for some time, that I would not be able to start life properly again, until I got my drivers license back. I have tried my best. Making it work where I can, but sometimes, it really fucking sucks. I have some days where I am very mean to myself because of it, but I do try to avoid this. Therapy isn't really an option for me, simply because in my country, it is very expensive and there is a waitlist of 2-3 years anyway. I don't know what I wanted with this post. It just feels good to get it out of my system I guess. I still walk around with shame every day, but I guess it does become a routine to just get on the bike every day instead. I feel like it is something I live with. Not something that gets better day by day. I am simply waiting for the 3 years to be up.",1764017159.0,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1p5sna8/feelings_of_extreme_shame_and_guilt_after_a_dui/,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1p5sna8/feelings_of_extreme_shame_and_guilt_after_a_dui/,,True,"idiot, kill, stupid",0.18,self_directed,"violence_type=self_directed; violence type: self_directed; example windows: my grandma would kill me if she; violent_hits=1; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0; self-directed wording (e.g. 'kill me') – not a call to harm others, but still potentially concerning.",False,,False

Tyson also plans to cut one of the two shifts at a plant in Amarillo, Texas, and eliminate 1,700 jobs there. Together those two moves will reduce beef processing capacity nationwide by 7-9%.

Two slaughterhouses control 7-9% of the US's capacity? Why did this happen?

&gt; But in the long run, beef prices may continue to climb even higher than the current record highs — caused by a variety of factors from drought to tariffs — unless American ranchers decide to raise more cattle, which they have little incentive to do.

Oh no. This is huge? Who could have predicted such dire consequences?

O'Connor has widely been described as conservative, and many of his rulings have been reversed on appeal. He has long been active in the Federalist Society, and is a contributor who has frequently spoken at the organization's events in Texas. According to his critics, O'Connor has become a ""go-to"" favorite for conservative lawyers, because, they claim, he reliably rules against Democratic policies and for Republican policies. Attorneys General in Texas appear to strategically file cases in O'Connor's jurisdiction so that he will hear them.

On March 26, 2015, O'Connor enjoined the federal government's definition of marriage as it relates to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.He dissolved the injunction following the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.

In early 2018, O'Connor held the Certification Rule of the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional in Texas v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, concluding that it violated the nondelegation doctrine. This ruling was reversed on appeal.

In 2018, O'Connor ruled that the Indian Child Welfare Act was unconstitutional. The Fifth Circuit reversed O'Connor's ruling on appeal, and the reversal was upheld by the Supreme Court in Haaland v. Brackeen (2023).",1762446408.0,239,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1oq39no/criminal_case_against_boeing_over_deadly_737_max/nnfwfm4/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

With this reflex, I tried to be nice. I accepted everybody, cared for those I stood around convincing myself that they were friends. What has that created? A boxing bag, which is myself. They pretended I was a softie, took advantage of my favor.

I hate everybody that use one other as a step to take to get attention. The things I want to do to those bullies break both the geneva convention and the Rule 5.

I really can't do anything. My mother, my father prevents me. They are a wall inbetween me and my freedom.

the friend group fell apart because of boy drama

edit2: people keep asking why she doesn’t want Sara to join. The answer is she doesn’t want to be the twin package anymore. She wants her own friend, she wants to be independent.

i can’t force them to sit together because that would make resentment. I can give a conversation about empathy witch i will do but it will not be a guilt trip becuase she Is allowed to say no to sitting with someone.

Maybe sit with her once and while at lunch would be good. Not all siblings are best friends and people treating them as the as a package  is the reason they are not close to begin with

———————

This is about my two girls ( twins) that are in freshman year of high school. I will call them Sara and Mia. During elementary school they were basically always  together. Middle school Mia started to feel resentment about always being with Sara so the school tried to split them up as much as possible. This was hard because the classes were not big. I made it a point to have activities that were just there own.

Mia got really into sport and Sara into theater. This seemed to help and we did more seperating. They got their own birthday parties and not a shared one for example. Mia really thrived with this but Sara did not. It has been a lot harder for Sara to be her own person ( Mia was always the dominate  twin when they were together) 

High school was a big change and for the first time they were completely separate, no shared classes. Sara has been having difficulties and it got worse this past month. The friend group she was hanging out with broke up and she has been sitting alone at lunch. 

Sara asked Mia to sit together with her friend group at lunch and Mia told her no. This resulted in in a big fight between the two. Mia point was these were her friends and Sara need to learn to make her own and basically not piggyback off Mia. Sara point was they were twins and she is sad sitting alone.

I told Sara very gently that Mai doesn’t have to sit with her at lunch and encouraged her to keep trying to make friends, and basically put herself back out there 

Sara has been crying since and my ex is giving me an earful. I don’t know if I made the right call on this",1764774652.0,1276,383,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pd6r8v/aita_for_not_making_my_twin_girls_sit_together_at/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pd6r8v/aita_for_not_making_my_twin_girls_sit_together_at/,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

1pcjgpj,TrueOffMyChest,,Cold_Advance_6315,I sustained a concussion 6 months ago. I wouldn’t wish this fate on anyone.,"6 months ago, I went out drinking, blacked out, and woke up the next morning with the worst hangover of my life. At least, I thought I was just hungover. Until I looked in the mirror and noticed a swollen lump on my forehead. I don’t remember what caused my injury, but in my drunken state, I had sustained a concussion.

The next few weeks were torture. My cognition was markedly slowed down, I had no control over my emotions, and my entire nervous system was completely out of whack. I went to the doctor, and there was little they could do besides tell me to eat healthy, exercise to the best of my ability, and get quality sleep.

Daily severe headaches made normal functioning impossible. Eventually I was referred to a physical therapist to help with neck issues, as most concussion injuries also cause whiplash or other neck problems. It didn’t really help.

Over the next few months, some of my symptoms subsided. Headaches come and go, and my cognition is back to 80-90% of where I was before. But my body is still carrying so much trauma. I’m stuck in fight-or-flight all the time. Panic attacks with no obvious trigger are a frequent occurrence. I’m trying to do everything right, I should be fully recovered by now, my initial injury wasn’t even that bad. Everyone else thinks I'm completey back to normal, but I'm barely holding it together.

I feel like a shell of myself. I can't imagine living the rest of my life like this, but at this point, I think this is as good as it gets.

Well I left to walk the dog with my grandpa and while i was gone, my aunt, let's call her Vicky, cornered my bf, Tyler, and started asking intrusive and inappropriate questions about my life, my choices and my body and making commentary about my late mother and how she ruined me from having a good relationship with the rest of the family.

Oh no don't do hot yoga (i don't) because you can get heat stroke. I sat there and held my tongue through that. Then Vicky started commenting on my body saying she wants me to be more fit. 

By then I'd had enough, after *years* of just sitting there and letting them verbally attack me for my decisions and choices and continuing to treat me (and tell Tyler that I am) nothing more than a broken child that needs fixing and medicating, I said ""I appreciate your concern but I don't appreciate commentary on my body at this time"" and the entire room dove into chaos. My Aunt was visibly upset, my sister started yelling, taking her side of course, and Vicky started crying saying that she was just trying to be nice because she doesn't know anything about my life.

ns3kfjh,politics,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik, a prominent ally of President Trump, criticized House Speaker Mike Johnson, calling him an ineffective leader who is losing control over the GOP conference headed into the midterm elections.

“He certainly wouldn’t have the votes to be speaker if there was a roll-call vote tomorrow,” the New York lawmaker, who is running for governor, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. “I believe that the majority of Republicans would vote for new leadership. It’s that widespread.”

The comments came Tuesday night as Stefanik was publicly sparring with Johnson over a legislative provision she wanted included in the annual defense-policy bill. On Wednesday morning, Stefanik said she had a “productive discussion” with Johnson and Trump and that her provision would be added to the bill.

Johnson, who easily survived a challenge to his speakership last year, struck a conciliatory tone after their discussion, telling reporters Wednesday that he thought the matter was resolved. “I never understood what all the disturbance was about,” he said, attributing the dispute to a breakdown in communication.

In the Journal interview, Stefanik painted Johnson’s standing with Republicans as in a state of collapse. She cited matters ranging from members criticizing his decision to keep lawmakers in their home districts during the recent government shutdown, to weak showings in special elections and to what she casts as his failure to address the expected jump in healthcare costs if the party doesn’t reach an agreement with Democrats soon.

It is the most critical Stefanik, 41 years old, has been of Johnson since the Louisiana congressman rose to the speakership in late 2023 following the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.). Johnson has led the chamber with razor-thin margins, successfully passing Trump’s tax bill in the summer. But more recently, four Republicans joined Democrats in forcing a vote on releasing files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, over the strong initial objections of Johnson and Trump.

“It’s all bubbling over,” said Stefanik, whose congressional probe into antisemitism on college campuses led to the resignations of multiple Ivy League presidents two years ago. “Whereas Kevin McCarthy was a political animal, Mike Johnson is a political novice and boy does it show, with the House Republicans underperforming for the first time in the Trump era.”

She also discounted Johnson’s closeness to Trump and argued that the president “is the leader of the Republicans and he certainly doesn’t need Mike Johnson.”

The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Johnson allies said they were bewildered by Stefanik’s criticism. “I don’t know why she’s choosing this moment to go after Mike,” said Rep. Pat Fallon (R., Texas). “He’s honest, he’s caring. He truly is the man that he reports himself to be.”

Rep. Richard Hudson (R., N.C.), chairman of House Republicans’ campaign arm, said Johnson “has been a fantastic leader for our conference from a political standpoint,” with a strong fundraising record. “Everything I’ve asked him to do, he’s far exceeded,” he said.

Stefanik began lashing out at Johnson in recent days over the provision she wanted attached to the annual defense authorization bill that Congress is pulling together. The provision, which she has been working on for years, would require Congress to be notified if the Federal Bureau of Investigation probes candidates running for president and other federal offices. She said on social media that Johnson was “getting rolled by House Dems attempting to block my provision.”

Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he wasn’t aware of any problems with the provision until Stefanik complained about it and that the proposal was being addressed through normal committee processes. “I don’t exactly know why Elise won’t just call me,” he said. “This wasn’t even on my radar.” He said he would work to fix the situation.

Stefanik fired back on social media that his comments were “just more lies.” She also signed onto a discharge petition led by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R., Fla.) designed to bypass GOP leadership and force a vote on a ban on congressional stock trading, a move that raised eyebrows within the GOP conference. Some questioned what her strategy was in going after the speaker.

Other Republicans have made jabs at Johnson. 

“It’s no secret that House leadership is refusing to do anything about congressional insider trading,” Rep. Greg Steube (R., Fla.), who has also been critical of party leaders in the past, wrote on X as he voiced support for the stock-ban push. “If the Speaker and Majority Leader won’t step up and do the right thing, we will.”

Before the president’s tax bill was passed, about two dozen Republicans warned that Johnson was losing trust with some in his conference. During the shutdown, a handful of Republicans such as Rep. Kevin Kiley (R., Calif.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.) criticized Johnson’s strategy for keeping House members home, though other Republicans backed the approach.

Despite the criticism, Johnson has also enjoyed support from the hard-line House Freedom Caucus—which has fought with leadership in the past—and a large faction of the party during the shutdown. He gets praise from many members for his cool demeanor, even amid turbulent times or when facing criticism from within his own party. Some lawmakers play down the results in recent special elections that have shifted toward Democrats, saying they don’t necessarily indicate how Republicans will fare in the coming year.

Stefanik, who came to Congress in 2015, has had a topsy-turvy year. She was the top ranking woman in GOP leadership when she was nominated by Trump to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. But her nomination was scratched after Trump and Johnson grew nervous about the GOP’s thin House majority, with the concern peaking during two special elections in Florida. Stefanik stayed in Congress and with a lesser leadership title—because her past post had already been filled—then announced her campaign for New York governor.

Stefanik alleges that Johnson opposed her nomination. Johnson allies contend that he only warned Trump to keep an eye on the GOP’s thin margin when plucking members from the House to serve in the administration and that the speaker backed her nomination once it was announced. They also note that Johnson, despite Stefanik’s criticisms at the time, worked to reinstall her in a leadership position and help her restore her seniority on the House Intelligence Committee.",1764782847.0,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1pdagwi/exclusive_trump_ally_elise_stefanik_attacks/ns3kfjh/,,,True,animal,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

ns1ngam,politics,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"&gt; Lawsuits accusing Donald Trump of sexually assaulting a child in the 1990s appear to have been orchestrated by an eccentric anti-Trump campaigner with a record of making outlandish claims about celebrities.

&gt; Norm Lubow, a former producer on the Jerry Springer TV show, has previously been involved with disputed allegations that OJ Simpson bought illegal drugs on the day Simpson’s wife was murdered, and that Kurt Cobain’s widow had the Nirvana frontman killed.



&gt; A publicist using the pseudonym “Al Taylor” is acting as a representative for Johnson, and has been shopping around to media outlets a video of a woman who wears a disguise while recounting the allegations against Trump. “Taylor” said in telephone calls last month that he was seeking $1m for the tape. Jezebel has published a segment of the video along with a detailed account of how the allegations against Trump were being pushed to reporters.

 &gt;A telephone number and an email address used by “Taylor” have also been used by Lubow, according to three sources who have worked with them. A longtime associate of Lubow also told the Guardian that Lubow used the identity “Al Taylor”.

&gt; “Taylor” told the Guardian that he helped the alleged victim Johnson put together her first lawsuit against Trump, which was filed in California earlier this year. “She is a friend of mine,” he said, declining to make her available for interview.

 &gt;He then became threatening when asked more about his motivations in seeking the money for the video and about his true identity. “Just be warned: we’ll sue you if we don’t like what you write,” he said. “We’ll sue your ass, own your ass and own your newspaper’s ass as well, punk.”

nroq83b,cars,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"Volkswagen engineers in one of China’s electric-vehicle hubs are looking to the country’s automotive industry for clues about how to speed up manufacturing and beat back local rivals in the world’s biggest auto market.

The German automaker has long been the number one manufacturer in a market dominated by gasoline-powered vehicles, but it has been losing market share as China’s market turns electric. It is now trying to figure out how to compete with upstart Chinese makers that can roll out good, affordable and highly digital electric cars—and do so in a third less time.

NissanMotor is similarly trying to produce cars faster by deploying tips it learned from a Chinese joint venture. Toyota Motor is bringing in engineers from its Chinese partnerships to better develop electric and smartcars.

The moves highlight a significant turnaround in the politically sensitive, employment-heavy auto industry. Whereas China once struggled to match, much less master, Western know-how in engines and drivetrains, it is now Western companies that need to learn from China.

This shift carries implications, not just for China’s market—where domestic carmakers account for around three-quarters of EV and plug-in hybrid sales—but also on global manufacturers’ home turf. China’s EV manufacturing methods, suppliers and digital technology could permeate global carmakers.

To head off what could become an onslaught of cheaper, sleeker Chinese electric vehicles, the U.S. has steep tariffs and the European Union is investigating Chinese subsidies to EV makers.

In the past, Volkswagen made cars in Europe and brought them into China with some adjustments, said Ralf Brandstätter, who heads Volkswagen’s China business. That approach no longer works because customer requirements in the electrified and more digital China market have become too different.

“We need to be more agile and focused,” he said last week at Volkswagen’s EV production, development and procurement hub in Hefei, west of Shanghai. The company will develop cars for China in the country while working with Chinese partners and making more decisions locally, he said.

The changes will help Volkswagen’s goal of being among the top three carmakers in China in 2030, Brandstätter said.

That is a downsized ambition for a company that has been leading car sales in China for decades. Homegrown BYD is chasing down its lead through sales of its pure electric and hybrid vehicles.

Some global automakers are already retreating or resetting their course. Japan’s Mitsubishi Motors is ending production in China, while Jeep-maker Stellantis stopped producing vehicles in China. Ford Motor pulled the plug on its electric car direct-sales business.

**Volkswagen turns to Chinese suppliers**

For Volkswagen, pulling back isn’t on the table. China is its biggest market, accounting for around 40% of vehicle sales.

The German automaker’s grip started to loosen several years ago, as it struggled to produce popular electric vehicles. 

Volkswagen takes a little less than four years to get a new product to the market, while Chinese companies are able to do so in a little more than 2½ years, Brandstätter has said. Now it is aiming to cut its vehicle development process to about 2½ years, he said.


That would be achieved through a bundle of actions, some of which are inspired by the Chinese way.


One is to use more Chinese components obtained from speedy local suppliers, rather than relying on German ones. From display and media systems to EV batteries and headlights, Volkswagen said sourcing these items from Chinese suppliers will cut development time by roughly 30% and costs by between 20% to 40%. 


Chinese suppliers have significantly improved in quality, durability and technology in the last four years or so, Volkswagen executives said. 

Local suppliers work with leading domestic carmakers and are a major part of China’s electric and intelligent vehicle ecosystem, which industry executives and experts say is a head above the rest. 


Volkswagen is also investing billions of dollars in local companies to get its hands on cutting-edge Chinese technology. Those include Chinese EV startup XPeng and battery maker Gotion High-Tech as well as Horizon Robotics, which makes automotive software and chips focused on autonomous driving, and ThunderSoft, which makes operating systems and software for smart cockpits. 

Volkswagen has also made management structure changes to move faster. At Hefei, the team will have the authority to approve components locally to save time going back and forth with headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. 

The team in Hefei is developing a new electric-vehicle platform for entry-level cars for the China market, set to be launched in 2026. By 2030, the carmaker plans to offer 30 electric models in China.

**Nissan tries to break the mold**

Nissan is also trying to speed things up to reverse sliding sales. It has picked up a few tips from Venucia, a local brand by Nissan and its Chinese joint venture partner Dongfeng Motor. One of those is how to move more quickly with vehicle testing.


Traditionally, Nissan waited months for some molds to be completed before using them to build test vehicles, a person with knowledge about the matter said. Now in China, the Japanese carmaker is in the process of using prototype molds instead.

To ensure quality, Nissan simultaneously plans to use more digital technologies, such as 3-D printers or virtual testing, to conduct additional tests, the person said. By 2026, Nissan plans to release under its badge four EV and plug-in hybrid models in China, developed at its R&amp;D center in the country, as well as six more under local badges with its joint venture.


A Nissan spokesperson said that the company acknowledges its joint venture has built strong capabilities, and that any testing meets Nissan’s global standards.


Toyota has shifted the focus of its China R&amp;D center to electric and smartcars, and is bringing on more engineers from its joint ventures for projects there.


Like Volkswagen, Toyota said in July that it would seek local suppliers, is revising component design and upgrading its production and manufacturing technology to cut costs in intelligent electric vehicles.

Many foreign brands fell behind in product cycles in China because they didn’t prepare early enough for the electrification trend that took off around 2020—and to catch up will take years, said Bill Russo, CEO of Automobility, a Shanghai-based strategy firm.

For now, many may have to rely on cost cutting and price discounts to boost sales, he said.",1764582781.0,15,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1pb8t1p/global_automakers_turn_to_china_for_ev_lessons/nroq83b/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

nr18zbl,news,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"WASHINGTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Investigators led by the FBI's joint terrorism task force sought clues on Thursday to what drove an Afghan immigrant to open fire on two National Guard soldiers mere blocks from the White House in what officials called an ""ambush"" attack on Thanksgiving eve.


The two soldiers, part of a militarized law enforcement mission ordered by President Donald Trump months ago and challenged in court by officials of the District of Columbia, were hospitalized in critical condition.

The suspect, who was wounded in an exchange of gunfire before he was arrested, was identified by the Department of Homeland Security as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national.


Trump, who was at his resort in Florida at the time of the attack, released a prerecorded video statement late on Wednesday calling the shooting ""an act of evil, an act of hatred and an act of terror."" He said his administration would ""re-examine"" all Afghans who came to the U.S. during Joe Biden's presidency.


The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency later said that it has halted processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely, ""pending further review of security and vetting protocols.""


According to the DHS, Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program to resettle thousands of Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the Afghanistan war and feared reprisals from Taliban forces who seized control of their homeland after the U.S. withdrawal.


NBC News, citing an interview with an unnamed relative of the suspect, reported early on Thursday that Lakanwal served in the Afghan army for 10 years alongside U.S. Special Forces troops and was stationed in Kandahar for part of that time.


The relative also said Lakanwal was working for online retail giant Amazon.com, the last time they spoke several months ago, according to NBC News.


The DHS did not include other details of his immigration record, but a Trump administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Lakanwal applied for asylum in December 2024 and was approved on April 23 of this year, three months after Trump took office. Lakanwal, 29, who resided in Washington state, had no known criminal history, the official said.


The shooting unfolded at midday outside a subway station in a bustling commercial area within a few blocks of the White House. Secret Service agents placed the presidential mansion under a security lockdown immediately after the shooting as a precaution.


In response to Wednesday's shooting, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the president had asked to send another 500 National Guard troops to join the more than 2,000 Guard soldiers previously mobilized in the nation's capital.

Vice President JD Vance, who was in Kentucky on Wednesday, said in a post on X that the shooting proved that the Trump administration's immigration policy was justified.


""We must redouble our efforts to deport people with no right to be in our country,"" he said.


Critics of the Trump administration's immigration policy say it has employed illegally harsh tactics and swept up immigrants indiscriminately, including some with no criminal history and others here legally.


**ATTACK OUTSIDE SUBWAY STATION**

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has clashed openly with Trump over the deployment of Guard troops in her city, told reporters hours after the incident, ""this is a targeted shooting.""


At the same news briefing, Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, said the two Guard soldiers were ""ambushed"" and that the known assailant appeared to have acted alone.


The two soldiers, members of the West Virginia National Guard, were on a ""high-visibility patrol"" outside the entrance to a subway station when the suspect ""came around the corner,"" drew a weapon and immediately fired at the pair, Carroll said.


After an exchange of gunfire, other National Guard troops subdued the suspect, he said.


Trump said in August he was ordering the National Guard deployment to fight crime in a city he said had become unsafe, despite objections from District of Columbia officials who challenged the move in court as an infringement on local government control.


Wednesday's shooting came five days after a federal judge issued a ruling to temporarily block National Guard troops from performing law enforcement duties in the district without the mayor's approval, but the judge paused the effect of her order until December to allow an appeal from the Trump administration.


Trump, a Republican, has deployed troops in several other Democratic-led cities - Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, Oregon, and Memphis, Tennessee - to combat what he has described as lawlessness and violent unrest over his crackdown on illegal immigration.

If I had to give one reason, it’s because there’s a lack of real competition. 

Look at the Chinese auto market, it’s the most fiercely competitive auto market in the world, and prices are at rock bottom. 

Firms there are innovating and becoming more and more vertically integrated (90% of their parts are manufactured in house vs 3rd party, they own their own supply chain, they’re more efficient, cost effective etc) 

If the US, and to an extent Europe, were to drop the 100%+ protective tariffs against Chinese imports, Western brands would have cause to: 

* Innovate  

* Scale (up) 

* Invest in manufacturing efficiencies 

* Drive down prices (using the buffer now built into their margin by reduced costs which result from the above 3 points) 

Without this kind of competition, there’s no real reason to upset the status quo.

nqunjjq,politics,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"Lawmakers will take aim at vehicle-safety mandates in a coming Senate hearing, targeting some auto-industry regulations once considered too sacrosanct to attack. 

Senate Republicans in January plan to criticize requirements for safety technology, such as automatic emergency braking and alarms to remind drivers that a child is in the back seat, arguing they are ineffective and will unnecessarily drive up the cost of cars, according to people familiar with the situation.

They aim to head off future requirements touted by safety advocates and argue instead for advancing autonomous vehicle technology.

Chief executives of Detroit’s three automakers and a senior Tesla executive have been summoned to appear at a hearing of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation—set for Jan. 14—to explain why vehicles have become so expensive. General Motors and Ford Motor are weighing whether to send their CEOs to the hearing, spokespeople said; Jeep-maker Stellantis declined to comment.

Sticker shock is hitting car buyers as the U.S. broadly faces what many consider to be a growing affordability crisis. The average price of a new vehicle hit $50,000 this fall, up from closer to $38,000 before the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, all facets of car ownership—from repairs to loans to insurance—have become costlier.

“Americans have been clear that they are hyper-focused on affordability,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), who chairs the committee, said in announcing the hearing.


Vehicle safety advocates argue such mandates save lives and don’t go far enough when some 40,000 people a year die on American roads.

“Regulation is the best way to make sure everybody’s got this technology that’s highly effective,” said a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. 

The hearing comes ahead of next year’s reauthorization of a $300 billion highway bill that provides money for road and rail projects and funding for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 

Republicans on the committee plan to contend that the most effective vehicle-safety advancements—seat belts and steps to improve vehicle crashworthiness—occurred between the 1960s and 1980s, and that benefits have dwindled since, the people said. Safety technology, such as sensors, can be ineffective and costly to repair, they will argue.

The push comes after the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers succeeded this year in unwinding so-called electric vehicle mandates and other environmental protections that helped usher in the now-sputtering EV movement.

Pinning down the factors behind rising car costs is complicated.

Republicans and major automakers, in advocating the end of some of the most-stringent federal and state clean-air and fuel-economy mandates this year, cited their high costs and that such regulations forced carmakers to shift toward pricier electric vehicles. The January hearing also is expected to address costs associated with clean-air regulations.

American drivers also have shifted to bigger vehicles with more costly creature comforts, such as heated steering wheels and vented seats. The top-selling vehicle in the U.S. is Ford’s F-150 pickup, which can top $70,000. 

While the Trump administration has spared U.S. automakers much of the brunt of President Trump’s trade war—and the car companies have largely swallowed added costs—analysts say some costs are invariably being passed on to consumers.

Automakers have long clashed with safety advocates, who are pushing companies to leverage new technology to prevent vehicle deaths.  

NHTSA has rules mandating certain technology, while automakers over the years have agreed to implement safety features voluntarily to pre-empt legislative mandates, such as rear-seat alerts intended to prevent child heatstroke deaths.

One of the more controversial safety mandates is for auto-braking technology systems, which use sensors, cameras and software to detect potential crashes and automatically apply the brakes. NHTSA last year required automatic braking systems in new cars starting in 2029; automakers have tried to block the rule from taking effect, arguing NHTSA’s standards are impractical and could cause rear-end collisions by braking before drivers expect. The agency said this year that it was considering extending the deadline.

Critics, including the auto industry’s main trade group, argue that specific mandates included in a Biden-era law are impractical and potentially dangerous. Supporters point to data showing the technology could prevent hundreds of deaths a year.",1764146727.0,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1p72smp/exclusive_senate_committee_to_challenge/nqunjjq/,,,True,"attack, die",0.13,descriptive,"violence_type=descriptive; violence type: descriptive; example windows: too sacrosanct to attack senate republicans in; violent_hits=1; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0; intense tone (many ALL CAPS words); violent words appear in descriptive context, not as a call to action.",False,,False

nqif78h,politics,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"Executives are starting to chill out about tariffs after a year of anxiety.

Months into President Trump’s roller coaster of a global trade war, something has shifted. Business leaders sound less gloomy about tariffs than they have for much of the year. They are talking less about risk when they discuss them with investors. And the subject is no longer dominating earnings calls like before. 

“We believe that the worst of the tariff and economic disruptions to our businesses are now behind us,” said David Maura, chief executive of Spectrum Brands SPB 5.68%increase; green up pointing triangle, which sells everything from pet food to insect repellent, on a call with investors this month. 

And for good reason. The real tariffs companies pay have turned out to be lower than the headline figures. Companies paid about 12% of the value of their imports as tariffs in October, consulting firm Oxford Economics estimates. That is about 10 percentage points higher than in January, but well below the most dramatic rates announced by the administration over the course of the year.

The U.S. has meanwhile hammered out new trade agreements, and Supreme Court justices this month questioned Trump’s authority to slap levies on nearly every country on Earth. Companies have also gotten better at mitigating the cost—securing exemptions, raising prices, cutting spending and rearranging supply chains.

The affordability crunch on voters’ minds could lead to further relief ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Trump dropped 40% tariffs on certain agricultural and food products from Brazil this past week. That is on top of the previous week’s rollback of duties on beef, coffee and dozens of other goods in response to Americans’ cost-of-living concerns.


Companies have passed along about two-thirds of tariff costs to consumers so far, excluding food and energy, down from closer to 100% in Trump’s first term, said Bernard Yaros, lead U.S. economist for Oxford Economics.

Big companies especially had healthy profit margins going into the year and have been able to absorb some of the cost.  

“What they’re saying is the tariffs are manageable for them,” said Parag Thatte, a Deutsche Bank equity analyst.

The Wall Street Journal analyzed data from more than 5,000 earnings calls held by publicly traded U.S. companies this year through Nov. 14. The analysis considered references by executives to tariffs, plus several related terms, in the same sentence as terms denoting risk. NL Analytics, which provided the data from call transcripts, also categorized executives’ statements referencing tariffs as positive, negative or neutral. 

At Ford Motors, CEO James Farley warned investors in February that tariff proposals at the time “would have a huge impact on our industry, with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out.”

In early May, about a month after Trump announced extensive “Liberation Day” tariffs, Farley projected that tariffs could cut earnings by a net $1.5 billion in 2025, before interest and taxes. Ford later bumped that estimate up to $2 billion.

A respite came this fall when the U.S. made two changes of significance for automakers. One expanded a program offsetting tariffs on some imported auto parts. That softened Ford’s estimate of how hard tariffs would hit 2025 results—cutting its earlier projection by half to $1 billion. The U.S. also jacked up duties on medium- and heavy-duty trucks.


On a late-October earnings call soon after, Ford executives were less negative, data from NL Analytics show. (Neutral mentions weren’t considered.)

The heavy-truck tariff doesn’t affect Ford, which doesn’t import heavy trucks, giving it a relative advantage over competitors that do, executives said.


Hershey entered the second quarter worried about tariffs on cocoa imports and retaliatory duties by Canada, as rising cocoa prices and other factors were also driving up costs. In late October, executives said they could no longer expect a blanket tariff exemption for cocoa imports, and projected a $200 million increase in tariff exposure in 2026. 

Still, in the company’s Oct. 30 call, finance chief Steven Voskuil cited “maybe a little bit more optimism on tariffs” as well as cocoa prices.

That optimism was borne out: In mid-November, the White House exempted cocoa and dozens of other foods and ingredients from much of the administration’s tariff regime.

“Cocoa was more than half of our total exposure, so the tariff impact has improved for ’26,” a Hershey spokeswoman said. 

Other companies are less sanguine.

MasterBrand, billed as North America’s biggest residential cabinet maker, was cautious but not pessimistic in May. “I don’t think the tariffs are having a massive amount of impact particular to our business,” CEO David Banyard told investors then. “We’re insulated a bit more than other industries.”

One uncertainty executives flagged: potentially significant costs if the administration imposed tariffs on wood-product imports or other materials. Among other factors, MasterBrand imports nearly all of its bathroom vanities from Mexico.

Trump in late September announced new tariffs rising to 50% on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and similar products. Tariffs knocked nearly a percentage point off MasterBrand’s gross margin in the third quarter. In October, previously announced duties on imported lumber and wood products kicked in, and MasterBrand said the impact could be as much as 8% of annual net sales before mitigation.

Ultimately, the company expects to offset its ongoing tariff costs, including by raising prices and renegotiating with suppliers. But that takes time, Banyard told investors. “That is the hardest part of this tariff regime,” he said. “It comes in fairly quickly, and it takes us time to mitigate it.”",1763982312.0,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1p5e69s/we_analyzed_5000_calls_to_find_out_what_ceos/nqif78h/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

npvltbo,politics,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"**Excavating the Builder’s Remedy**

About a decade ago, the California Legislature started revving up its housing efforts again by sharpening the existing laws’ teeth. Among those changes were two tweaks that would prove pivotal: Urban areas would now have to plan for much more housing than they had in the past, and it became easier for developers to sue cities that deny their projects.

Those efforts got an unexpected boost on New Year’s Day 2019. That afternoon, Christopher Elmendorf, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, whose social media account is followed closely by developers and their lawyers, published a thread on Twitter. In it, he detailed a little-noticed clause that, in certain instances, could nullify a city’s zoning completely.

“CA housing folks: Why haven’t builders exploited the state law exempting 20%-affordable projects from zoning / plan in cities that don’t accommodate enough?” it began.

What he had suggested was the land use equivalent of plutonium.

Over more than a dozen tweets, Mr. Elmendorf argued that since 1990, California had had a loophole that allowed developers to bypass the local zoning codes in cities whose housing element was deemed noncompliant by the state. In a follow-up paper, he called it the “builder’s remedy,” a nod to a similar mechanism that arose from New Jersey court rulings that have shaped housing policy in that state.

The clause had rarely been used. But, as it happened, the conditions for exploiting it were historically perfect. Cities across the state were about to be hit with increases in housing target numbers so steep that regulators were all but guaranteed to deem their plans noncompliant.

Few cities saw a bigger impact than Beverly Hills: The city’s previous housing element required it to plan for three (yes, three) new housing units. Under the new allocation that would take effect in 2023, it had to plan for more than 3,000.

Beverly Hills did file a plan for more than 3,000 units, but placed most of them in high-traffic areas occupied by retail and office buildings, including the headquarters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Was a developer really going to turn the academy’s building into apartments and condos?

An advocacy group called Californians for Homeownership sued the city, arguing that much of the new housing that Beverly Hills had planned for would never be built. A judge agreed, and the city’s housing element was ruled out of compliance with state regulations.

Even so, many builders were reluctant to bring builder’s remedy cases, worried that those projects would alienate cities that they would likely have to work with in the future.

“Just like any other industry, sometimes you need a few pirates to change the dynamic,” said Dave Rand, a partner at Rand Paster &amp; Nelson in Los Angeles, a land-use firm that represents Leo Pustilnikov.

Mr. Pustilnikov was willing to be that pirate.

**Remaking Cities (and Suburbs)**

On a recent afternoon I met Mr. Pustilnikov at a white-tablecloth Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills about a mile from his Linden Drive lot. Mr. Rand, his lawyer, had told me to look for the worst-dressed guy in the room. Sure enough, there I found Mr. Pustilnikov waiting for me in shorts, flip-flops and a T-shirt whose collar appeared to have just come out of a tug of war.

Munching bread while waiters wearing ties moved from table to table, Mr. Pustilnikov explained that his specialty were deals with “hair,” by which he means complicated transactions with a lot of risk. Until recently, his public profile came mostly from being the owner of several aging buildings in downtown Los Angeles that are set aside for low-income tenants, many of them exiting homelessness.

As for the builder’s remedy projects he had proposed in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, West Hollywood and Redondo Beach, he told me that in most cases he didn’t plan to build them himself. Rather, his hope is to get the buildings entitled and sell the land to another builder for a premium. This would allow him to profit from engaging in the sort of pitched battle — in other words, hair — that a more conflict-averse developer might be reluctant to tackle.

Beverly Hills was a particularly enticing target. On paper it is an independent municipality of 32,000 people with its own school district and police department where boundaries are marked by the city’s iconic, shield-shaped signs. But it is surrounded by Los Angeles.

When Mr. Pustilnikov began pursuing the Linden tower, builder’s remedy projects had to set aside 20 percent of their units for below-market-rate tenants. (The percentage has since been lowered by new state legislation.) Paradoxically, building affordable units is more feasible in affluent areas like Beverly Hills because developers can charge much higher rents on the market-rate units.

Beverly Hills has since seen 16 applications for builder’s remedy developments. Residents are appalled. In letters opposing Linden Drive, neighbors said the project would destroy the neighborhood by encouraging other developers to “build huge” and made it feel as if “the walls are caving in, and we have no word.”

“None of us are opposed to affordable housing,” said Kenneth Goldman, president of the Southwest Beverly Hills Homeowners Association. But a building that was almost four times the city’s height limit?

“You don’t have to be a NIMBY to say that’s just so far out of line,” he said.

After Mr. Pustilnikov submitted the Linden Drive project, the City Council unanimously rejected his proposal.

The city was sued — twice, first by Californians for Homeownership and then by Mr. Pustilnikov. The suits were joined, and in August, Judge Curtis A. Kin — who, because this is Southern California, was once a contestant on the reality-TV show “Big Brother” — ruled for Mr. Pustilnikov. Beverly Hills still has a month to appeal the decision, but it would be expensive. To discourage cities from dragging out development fights in court, state law mandates that cities appealing their losses for this type of case post a bond that can easily eclipse $10 million.

The Linden Drive litigation is likely to be a bellwether, Mr. Rand said, prompting other cities to approve builder’s remedy projects outright or at least quickly cut deals with developers.

In the months since Mr. Pustilnikov’s court victory, the Beverly Hills Planning Commission has voted to approve nine builder’s remedy projects, totaling 659 units. That would be more housing than Beverly Hills had built in recent memory.

**How to Create a Credible Threat**

If California is ever going to dent its housing problem, it will have to figure out how to make it easier to add more housing in urban cores. Sprawl remains the cheapest and most effective way to add a lot of housing in a hurry, and there’s almost no way the nation can solve its housing shortage without building a lot more of it.

But in California and around the country, the highest rents and worst cost burdens are almost always in the job-rich areas that are already developed. Figuring out how to build housing in neighborhoods where building is expensive and difficult, and large blocs of voters reject it, is a puzzle that no U.S. city has fully solved.

Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist, and Joseph Gyourko, a finance professor at the Wharton School, noted in a recent paper that many of the fast-growing Sun Belt cities — the ones to which people priced out of California tend to relocate — had seen a sharp run-up in housing costs. The reason, the authors concluded, is that their residents are no more enthusiastic about adding density in single-family neighborhoods than are the people of Berkeley or Beverly Hills.

To once again become the nation’s housing pioneer, California will have to develop the political will to reform its urban areas and old suburbs into something denser and easier to navigate without a car. The lesson of the builder’s remedy is that, so far, the most effective way of doing this is to create a credible threat that housing-averse cities can’t ignore.

Last year, the Legislature passed a bill, introduced by Ms. Wicks, that explicitly codified the builder’s remedy in a modified form: Developers could more easily avail themselves of the tactic in exchange for set limits on density. They cannot build anything they want, but the allowable densities are still several times as large as what local zoning rules allow.

The ultimate impact of the builder’s remedy is likely to be measured not just in units that are built by using it, but in the ones built in fear of it. A few years ago, when Santa Monica was working on its housing element, Jesse Zwick, who was running to be a member of the City Council, sat in frustration while his future colleagues voted for a plan that the state ultimately rejected for failing to provide enough units, he said.

Then developers, including Mr. Pustilnikov, came along, and the wealthy beachfront city was blanketed with housing proposals. The city ended up settling with builders, and the effect is likely to be felt long after.

“The fear of builder’s remedy brought along a lot of people whose inclination was to fight everything,” Mr. Zwick said. “They realized it was in our interest to grow and at least be able to have a say in how we do that.”",1763660130.0,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1p29b5q/the_housing_strategy_that_has_california_nimbys/npvltbo/,,,False,,0.02,none,violence_type=none; only generic hate words in non-violent context; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=1,False,,False

One way or the other, the answer was going to be yes.

When Leo Pustilnikov filed an application in 2023 with the City of Beverly Hills to build a 19-story apartment tower with a hotel, the developer didn’t care that it flouted the zoning code or that the City Council was unanimously opposed to the project or that neighbors had described it as a “monstrosity.” He had the city backed into a corner and wasn’t going to pretend otherwise.

“My philosophy is always this: If I can work with a city, I’m more than happy to,” Mr. Pustilnikov said. “When a city doesn’t want to help, I have no problem ignoring them and doing it my way.”

This was not the way business was normally done in Beverly Hills, a famously wealthy enclave where development is tightly controlled. It’s a tough place to build. Land is expensive, labor is expensive and NIMBYism — the not-in-my-backyard sentiment that exists everywhere — is particularly strong. The city’s zoning rules discourage projects that are tall and bulky and that might anger the owners of single-family houses nearby. Five stories is the tallest allowable height for a multifamily residential building — and those are permitted on only a few blocks of the city.

Mr. Pustilnikov was determined to change that. After two decades of investing in low-income apartments in downtown Los Angeles, he had stumbled upon a little-known state law that allowed him to ram high-density projects like the 19-story tower on South Linden Drive into cities that didn’t want them.

The law is called the “builder’s remedy,” and it was designed to break the political logjams that have made California one of the most difficult places in the country to build. The law works by nullifying local zoning rules when cities fail to plan for enough housing as required by the state.

While the builder’s remedy has been on the books since 1990, it was effectively dormant until 2022. Since then, however, developers across the state have filed dozens of plans to build 10- and 20-story buildings in neighborhoods where they had never been allowed. Mr. Pustilnikov, who helped pioneer the tactic, has proposed 10 such projects across Los Angeles County.

Brian Hanlon, chief executive of California YIMBY, a group that pushes for more housing, referred to the builder’s remedy as “the NIMBY sword of Damocles.” Just the threat of it has prompted cities to accept more housing than they had in decades.

California’s housing crisis is well documented and severe. But it’s not unique. From New York to Los Angeles, and countless smaller places in between, a festering housing shortage has forced Americans to spend more of their budgets on shelter, making them feel poorer and stuck in place.

There is wide agreement that America hasn’t been able to build enough housing; the need to do something about the shortage is one of the few things Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on. Despite this, the gap between the abstract agreement that we need more housing and the construction of a specific project on a specific block makes it difficult to build what the country requires.

Interest groups are reluctant to curb regulations, such as environmental rules, that can add years even to small projects. And the desire to keep a neighborhood from changing is deeply ingrained in local politics and the human psyche. There are just too many things to object to: Traffic. Not enough parking. Complaints that the building is poorly designed or blots out sunlight, or should be a park instead.

To address this, Sacramento legislators have spent the past decade writing a slew of laws that aim to create more housing. The laws vary from tiny coding changes that ease the way for backyard “granny flats” to a tectonic rewrite of the state’s landmark environmental law. The net effect is to nudge neighborhoods to become taller and denser by eroding local control over land use. Other states, including Oregon, Massachusetts, Montana, Texas and Arizona, have used similar tactics to increase the housing supply.

Buffy Wicks, a Democrat in the State Assembly from Oakland who has written several laws to speed housing production, argues that the state has to slice through both local rules and the bureaucracy that the state itself produced.

“We have gotten in our own way and created a quagmire that makes it impossible to build the housing we need,” she said.

The builder’s remedy has the potential to supercharge this, though it’s still too early to say how effective it will ultimately be. So far, developers seem to have the upper hand: When cities have challenged the cases, builders have often won. In response, cities have started reluctantly approving taller buildings that used to be unthinkable. In August, Mr. Pustilnikov prevailed in a case against Beverly Hills over the Linden Drive project.

“It is unfortunate that the state has seen fit to take a good deal of local zoning out of the hands of cities,” said Larry Wiener, the city attorney for Beverly Hills, in a statement.

The irony is that the builder’s remedy was rediscovered almost by accident. Even Ms. Wicks, one of California’s most staunchly pro-housing lawmakers, said the Legislature would never be able to pass the law now because of opposition from local governments. Thus, one of California’s most effective laws for building housing was not a product of its housing emergency or political will, but a legislative relic.

“The politics to pass anything resembling builder’s remedy would be way too difficult today,” Ms. Wicks said. “So one of the most powerful tools in combating our housing crisis is a law that passed” three decades ago.

Mr. Pustilnikov wasted no time trying to teach the city a lesson. After the judge ruled in his favor, he threatened to amend the Linden Drive building to make it even taller.

**Building Where People Live**

A truism of development is that it is harder to build things where people live than where they don’t. In the decades after World War II, California grew to become the most populous state not by constructing tall buildings but by spreading subdivisions over farms and orchards and connecting them with thousands of miles of freeways. Sun Belt cities like Dallas and Phoenix copied that playbook.

The backlash to sprawl came in the 1960s and ’70s, with local growth moratoriums and fights against freeways. As an alternative, environmentalists suggested building more densely in existing cities, what became known as smart growth.

But as much as people might lament paving over a cow pasture, nothing seems to rile them up as much as new construction in their own neighborhood. Over the past 30 years, California’s Legislature has been trying to counteract this hyperlocal opposition. The process has been a zigzagging slog. But the overall trend shows the state trying to wrest power from local governments. The laws the state created play out mostly out of public view through a web of arcane planning processes, the end result of which is a document called a “housing element.”

A housing element is basically a planning report that cities have to file with the state every eight years. In it, they detail, over hundreds of pages of maps and dense bureaucratese, how they plan to permit a certain amount of housing at various levels of affordability, a number that is decided by state and regional governments.

The problem is that the process has historically been a charade. Cities often produced housing elements that positioned future housing in inaccessible areas, and while developers and the state could challenge the plans, usually neither did. Since local officials were beholden to voters who rarely wanted new development, little was built.",1763660089.0,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1p29b5q/the_housing_strategy_that_has_california_nimbys/npvlo3y/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

npufpqr,politics,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"U.S. job growth defied expectations in September, according to a Labor Department report issued nearly seven weeks late due to the government shutdown.
Payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 119,000 on the month, the strongest gain since April, the Labor Department said Thursday.

That was well above the gain of 50,000 jobs economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected to see.

However August’s payrolls number was revised to a loss of 4,000 jobs, and July’s payrolls were revised slightly lower to a 72,000 gain. That meant employment in July and August combined was 33,000 lower than previously reported.

The unemployment rate, which is based on a separate survey from the jobs figures, rose slightly to 4.4% as nearly half a million people joined the labor force. Economists expected the unemployment rate to hold at 4.3%.


Though greatly delayed—these numbers were initially scheduled for release on Oct. 3—the September report offered the first official look since before the shutdown on the state of a critical economic marker for investors and policymakers. The Federal Reserve, for instance, uses the job report to help it make decisions about interest rates.

The longest shutdown on record began Oct. 1. Before ending last week, it put a halt to nearly all the government economic data releases that Wall Street and policymakers rely on to measure the economy’s health.

The government won’t be able to completely fill in the blanks. The Labor Department said Wednesday it won’t release an unemployment rate for October because it couldn’t collect the necessary data. It will release data from a separate survey on the number of jobs created or lost in October with the November payrolls report, which the agency scheduled for release on Dec. 16.

That means the Federal Reserve will be heading into its next policy gathering on Dec. 9-10 with a stale picture of the job market in recent months. The Labor Department hasn’t said whether it will produce a consumer-price index report for October, but the White House has said it is unlikely.

Minutes of the Fed’s October gathering showed deepening divisions over whether the central bank should cut interest rates next month.
“Participants expressed strongly differing views about what policy decision would most likely be appropriate at the committee’s December meeting,” according to a written record of the meeting released Wednesday afternoon with the customary three-week lag. The minutes noted that “available indicators were consistent with a continued gradual cooling in the labor market without any evidence of a sharp deterioration.”

While the federal data are incomplete, there are other signs that the labor market remains unsettled. Major companies including Amazon.com and Target recently announced they were cutting thousands of corporate jobs.

Meantime, consumer sentiment dropped in early November on concerns about the shutdown’s negative economic impact, according to a survey by the University of Michigan. More than 70% of households said they expect unemployment to increase over the next year.



A survey from the National Federation of Independent Business found small-business optimism also declined slightly in October. Owners reported lower sales and reduced profits, NFIB said, and many firms said they were having difficulty finding labor.


Despite the dearth of government data in recent weeks, estimates for economic growth in the third quarter point to a strong showing. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model forecasts annualized economic growth of 4.2% for the July to September period.


The third quarter was largely strong for company earnings—Nvidia reported record sales and strong guidance Wednesday, helping soothe jitters about an artificial-intelligence bubble. But some companies cautioned that consumers are increasingly bifurcated, with high income households spending strongly while younger and lower-income consumers are under strain.



Earlier this week, Home Depot reported lower third-quarter profit and trimmed its full-year outlook, as economic uncertainty, high interest rates and a stagnant housing market prompted homeowners to scale back home improvements.


“Our customers tell us that they remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty and perhaps the hesitation to make larger financial commitments amid an uncertain economic environment,” Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said Tuesday.


Target on Wednesday trimmed its profit guidance for this year, saying fewer shoppers visited its stores in the third quarter and those who did spent less. The quarter was volatile because of several external factors, such as the pause in federal food-assistance benefits funding and the government shutdown, according to incoming Chief Executive Michael Fiddelke.",1763647475.0,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1p23wdj/hiring_defied_expectations_in_september_with/npufpqr/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

Chinas auto market is the most competitive on Earth, with competition between Chinese firms driving costs down as well as increasing the pace of innovation. Costs in this case are both internal cost to manufacture, as well as to the end user. 


Western firms are not able to match the verticality of their internal supply chain, or the speed at which these firms can bring new models / upgrades to market.

&gt; OpenAI and Intuit   agreed to a multiyear partnership in which the financial technology firm will deepen its use of OpenAI models and make applications available on the artificial intelligence company’s ChatGPT.

&gt; The companies said they expect the deal to generate more than $100 million in revenue for OpenAI over an unspecified number of years.

&gt; Intuit will gain extensive access to OpenAI’s APIs. The companies said the partnership will allow Intuit to leverage OpenAI frontier models for cutting-edge use cases across the business. The contract also includes Intuit’s continued use of ChatGPT Enterprise across the company. It helps Intuit employees incorporate AI into daily workflows and further improve productivity, the companies said.

&gt; The combination of ChatGPT’s accessibility and Intuit’s expertise is “a way to unlock financial literacy…at a scale that hasn’t been tried before,” said Simo. OpenAI announced in May that she was joining the company. Her prior roles included CEO of Instacart   and head of the Facebook   app.

&gt; “We are turning ChatGPT from a tool that was very useful, but fairly insular and not connected to the rest of the ecosystem, into a tool that is connected to incredibly helpful services,” she said.

&gt; The idea is to make ChatGPT useful in every part of life, without simply backing a series of applications in one super app. Rather, the idea is to create a “personal super assistant,” Simo said.

&gt; The deal comes at a time when anxiety over AI is felt at multiple levels, from stock valuations and debt levels to the ability of AI and data center companies to generate enough revenue to justify it all.

&gt; Over time, Goodarzi said AI will “spark more global innovation than the world experienced with the advent of electricity or the internet. I think that’s not overblown.” However, he cautioned that the pace at which consumers and businesses fully integrate AI into every part of their lives is “a bit overblown,” because difficult tasks such as those involving money and finance require high trust and accuracy.",1763471566.0,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1p0bhx6/openai_intuit_strike_strategic_partnership/nphjbqr/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

nosef32,politics,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"Could there be a better example of Congressional dysfunction than that its first pressing business after the government reopens is . . . the return of the Jeffrey Epstein follies? This is exactly what the American people weren’t waiting for.

But this is Washington in 2025, so everyone is obsessing about Epstein’s emails from the grave that mention Donald Trump long before he was President. Democrats selectively leaked the emails (acquired as part of a Congressional investigation) that refer to Mr. Trump. Republicans countered by releasing thousands of other emails that are embarrassing for many but tell us little new about the deceased sexual offender.

Everyone knew Mr. Trump and Epstein palled around in New York in the 1990s and early 2000s, though they later had a falling out. This was clear in the 2024 election and it had become an issue in Mr. Trump’s first term when Democrats assailed a plea bargain struck by Labor Secretary Alex Acosta when he had been a prosecutor in Florida. Mr. Acosta resigned—needlessly, we said at the time, because the plea deal at least guaranteed a felony conviction and Epstein served 13 months in jail.

The new Epstein email getting the most attention is from 2011 addressed to his fellow trafficker in young women, Ghislaine Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump. . . [Victim’s name redacted] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75% there.” 

The email’s context isn’t clear, nor do we know what being “75% there” means. The victim in question, the tragic Virginia Giuffre, said publicly before she committed suicide that Mr. Trump never participated in anything nefarious. She certainly wasn’t reticent about other men in the Epstein circle.

Democrats, and a few Republicans, are demanding again that the Justice Department release all of its Epstein files for the sake of “transparency.” There appear to be enough votes in the House to pass a discharge petition commanding the release of those files, with a possible vote next week. 

The complication for the transparency crowd is that the Biden Justice Department had all of these documents for four years and could have released them. They also could have used them to prosecute others besides Ms. Maxwell (now in prison) and Epstein if they thought they could get a conviction. Biden officials certainly weren’t shy about attacking or even indicting Mr. Trump.

As is so often the case, Mr. Trump has been his own worst enemy here. As a candidate he fanned the expectations of the Epstein conspiracy theorists who think government is protecting the rich and powerful. Once in power, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel teased explosive findings but later said there’s nothing to see.

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has resorted to his usual default that it’s all a “hoax,” even as he strong-arms Republicans to oppose the discharge petition. He looks like he has something to hide even if he doesn’t.

What Ms. Bondi should have done long ago is call a press conference, explain why she doesn’t want to release more files than she already has, and take the media heat. There are good reasons of privacy and unfair guilt by association not to dump hundreds of thousands of pages of raw FBI investigatory files into the public arena. Some victims who so far may not have been publicly identified could also be hurt. 



Democrats want to keep the Epstein story going because it embarrasses Mr. Trump, and maybe the files will cough up something worse. Republicans don’t want to get cross-wise with that part of the MAGA base that thinks everything is a deep-state conspiracy. This is what passes these days for doing the people’s business in Washington.",1763117035.0,-14,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1owt6bh/the_epstein_follies_return/nosef32/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

The turning point in the government’s longest shutdown didn’t involve President Trump or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

Instead, after the Senate adjourned for the day and most reporters had emptied out of the halls, a small group of breakaway Democrats and an independent slipped unnoticed into the office of Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R., S.D.).

The shutdown was nearing the one-month mark and the group was growing antsy as federal workers missed paychecks and food-aid programs ran out of money. Two nights before Halloween, the senators sat down with Thune, ready to reopen the government, people familiar with the meeting said. “It was a group of people trying to solve a problem,” said Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and helped lead negotiations. 

The meeting—one of several—had been requested by King and other centrists, including New Hampshire’s Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, all former governors. Republicans in attendance were Thune and Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota, also a former governor and senior member of the powerful appropriations committee.

The group told Schumer they were talking to Thune and read him into their discussions, but Schumer didn’t participate directly, according to senators involved. Schumer wanted to extend the shutdown, arguing Trump would eventually engage in talks himself and they would get a better deal—one that would address expiring Obamacare health-insurance subsidies that Democrats had made their central demand in the shutdown fight, people familiar with Schumer’s position said.

The talks between the centrists and Republicans ultimately produced an agreement that would end the standoff but divide Democrats, with some seeing it as a failure of Schumer’s gamble that he could hold his caucus together long enough to force Trump to the negotiating table.

Throughout the shutdown, Schumer, the Senate’s most powerful Democrat, was on the sidelines, allowing a small subset of his conference to engage with Senate Republicans. The deal they reached funded much of the government through Jan. 30 and some programs, such as food aid, for a full year. It has enraged many progressives and party activists, who say that the group got virtually nothing in return, and many have directed their anger at Schumer even though he didn’t vote for it. Schumer’s critics say his inability to keep his party united is an indictment of his leadership.

Those Democrats’ biggest gripe is that they are walking away with no guarantees that expiring health-insurance subsidies will be extended. In the negotiations with Thune, the group of centrist Democrats were willing to forgo such a guarantee: Thune offered them a vote on the subsidies by mid-December, though he wouldn’t promise an outcome.

Shaheen said that meeting face to face with Thune helped convince her that he would keep his word. 

“We sat across from him, we looked him eye to eye,” Shaheen said. She also has a backstop, since much of the funding expires at the end of January, when Democrats could trigger a shutdown again. “That’s certainly an option that I think everybody will consider,” Shaheen said.


**Divided Democrats**

King, Shaheen, Hassan and other centrist Democrats updated Schumer regularly on their discussions with Thune and Republican appropriators, lawmakers said. In addition to Hoeven, they were working with Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the appropriations chair, and Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama.

They believed that Schumer would carry more Democrats with him if he voted yes. Schumer told the group that he was open to a deal, as he had said publicly, but he thought what they had come up with wasn’t strong enough and suggested changes, a senator and aides familiar with the conversations said. He also asked them to wait on committing to anything until after Nov. 1, the start of Obamacare open enrollment, and then until after Election Day on Tuesday, Nov. 4., which they agreed to do.

Frustrated Republicans publicly accused Schumer of holding their Democratic partners back. King said Schumer was providing feedback. “We weren’t trying to end-run him, and he had some input into what we were working on,” King said.

On Election Day, Shaheen presented the centrists’ plan to their caucus at a lunchtime meeting, hours before polls closed in Virginia, New Jersey and other states, people familiar with the lunch said. More than a dozen Democrats were interested in the deal but not yet ready to vote for it.


Most of the caucus still wanted to stick together, especially once the full extent of their party’s landslide election victories became clear Wednesday morning.

But the shutdown was hitting new pain points. Flight delays piled up starting Friday. Some constituents had lost several paychecks. Others had lost federal food-assistance benefits or subsidies to heat their homes.

By Sunday, eight Democrats were no longer willing to wait.

**The strategy ‘wasn’t working’**

Schumer’s allies say he did the best he could with a bad hand and pointed out that few Republicans had expected Senate Democrats to hold out as long as they did.

But King said it had become apparent to him and others involved in talks with Republicans over the past few weeks that Trump wasn’t going to engage.

“We were harming a lot of people in the service of a strategy that wasn’t working. That’s it in a nutshell,” King said. 

Instead of negotiating, the White House nixed plans for stand-alone votes that would have paid air-traffic controllers or funded food stamps, rejected meeting requests from Democrats and refused to negotiate on healthcare until the government reopened.

Schumer made what would be his final offer on Friday: Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to extend expiring subsidies for a year. Republicans immediately rejected the move and the centrists’ deal gained momentum over the weekend. 

On Sunday, Schumer said he couldn’t vote for a deal “that fails to address the healthcare crisis.” With limited Democratic support, Republicans needed Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.) to be the critical eighth vote. Britt said she worked with Kaine, the White House and GOP leadership to add language reversing federal layoffs initiated during the shutdown—and banning future layoffs through the end of January.

With Kaine now a yes, the Senate overcame a key procedural hurdle in a 60-40 vote late Sunday, advancing the measure to reopen the government with not a single vote to spare.

Schumer, who had drawn scorn in March for voting with Republicans to avert a shutdown, now drew scorn for failing to keep a shutdown going. He has claimed a partial victory in making healthcare costs the centerpiece of Democrats’ fight heading into midterm elections.

In a speech on Monday, Schumer warned that Trump and other Republicans will come to regret not negotiating to fix the subsidies when they had the chance.

“Republicans now own this healthcare crisis,” he said. “They knew it was coming. We wanted to fix it. Republicans said no.”",1763036668.0,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1ovzlfc/the_secret_meeting_that_ended_the_shutdown/nomd8m9/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

President Trump pressured Democrats by taking punishing actions no previous administration ever took during a shutdown.

The government shutdown is already the longest in American history. But it’s also perhaps the most punishing, in part because President Trump has taken actions no previous administration ever took during a shutdown.

Over the past six weeks, the Trump administration cut food stamps for millions of low-income Americans. It tried to fire thousands of government workers and withhold back pay from others, while freezing or canceling money for projects in Democratic-led states.

It remains to be seen whether there will be a political price to pay for Mr. Trump or his party, with polls showing that voters generally blamed Republicans more for the shutdown. But for now, the tactics appear to have worked, after a group of Democrats agreed to support a bill to end the shutdown and drop the concessions their party had demanded.

“Standing up to Donald Trump didn’t work,” Senator Angus King, independent of Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, said on MSNBC Monday. “It actually gave him more power.”

The bare-knuckle politics the Trump administration employed during the shutdown — often coming from his budget director Russell T. Vought, whom Mr. Trump refers to as Darth Vader — became too brutal for the handful of centrist Senate Democrats, who never liked the idea of the shutdown much anyway.

The deal they voted for on Monday reverses much of the pain Mr. Trump inflicted. Under its terms, the president must rescind his layoffs and restore back pay to other government workers. Democrats will also get a vote on extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, something that Senate Republicans weeks ago offered them.

While the shutdown may be ending, Democratic officials say the party learned a lesson that base voters reward them when they fight. Democratic leaders view last week’s elections, with big victories in governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia, as evidence that their strategy was working. They point to polling that indicates that the public was blaming Mr. Trump and Republicans more than Democrats for the shutdown.

“Republicans all across the country got wiped out,” said Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the top Democrat in the House, adding, “As House Democrats, we know we’re on the right side of this fight.”

Democrats also believe they now have an issue to run on in the midterm elections. They have highlighted issues important to voters, positioning themselves in the public’s mind as the party fighting for lowering health care costs, while they can contrast those efforts with the Trump administration’s attempts to deny food stamps to needy families.

But Trump officials have also learned a lesson.

If they wait out Democrats long enough — and turn up the pain enough — they will back down.

Early in the shutdown, White House officials had predicted Democrats would eventually fold. They saw little need for Mr. Trump to negotiate with the Democratic leaders, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Mr. Jeffries.

The strategy, White House officials said, was to wait out the Democrats, ramp up the pain and then watch as they eventually caved.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said he approves of the deal under consideration to reopen the federal government.

“We’ll be opening up our country very quickly,” Mr. Trump said. Asked if that meant he would back off his attempts to fire federal workers, he said: “I’ll abide by the deal. The deal is very good.”

Mr. Trump also made it clear that he wants to position the Republicans as the party that is working for lower health care costs. He said he wants to move toward a health care system that cuts out insurance companies.

“We want a health care system where we pay the money to the people instead of the insurance companies,” he said. “And I tell you, we’re going to be working on that very hard over the next short period of time.”

But Mr. Trump offered no details about what such a plan could look like or how it could save money for consumers.

There may still be more fallout from the shutdown even after it is resolved.

Some House Democrats, dissatisfied that Mr. Schumer couldn’t better control his caucus and hold the line on Democratic demands, called for him to be replaced.

“Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, said in a post on X. “If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?”

But Mr. Jeffries said he was standing by his counterpart in the Senate.

“The overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, have waged a valiant fight over the last seven weeks,” Mr. Jeffries said.",1762879955.0,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1ouel2l/for_trump_nothing_was_off_limits_during_the/nob2q6m/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

Republican National Committee, asks the justices to determine the meaning of “Election Day.” It is a potential blockbuster and adds to the court’s other elections and voting cases for the term, which include a case about who can sue to challenge Illinois’ mail-in ballot rules and a challenge to the Louisiana congressional district map that could gut a remaining pillar of the Voting Rights Act.

The Republican National Committee challenged Mississippi’s mail-in ballot rules, arguing that Congress had intended that voting take place on a single Election Day and that allowing ballots to arrive days later and still be counted undermined election integrity and the public’s trust in the vote.

Mississippi argued that Congress only set a date by when voters must make their choice, not the date by when ballots must arrive. Mississippi defended its grace period, which is similar to ones in place in many other states, as allowing elections officials to count ballots that have been mailed by Election Day but arrive a few days after.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, generally viewed as one of the nation’s most conservative appeals courts, sided with the R.N.C. The appeals court struck down Mississippi’s grace period, which let it count absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day if the ballots arrived up to five business days later.",1762803647.0,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1otnodt/supreme_court_to_hear_major_challenge_to_mailin/no5quef/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a long-shot bid to overturn the landmark 2015 decision that gave same-sex couples the constitutional right to marry. 

The court, in a brief written order, turned away an appeal by Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk who was sued by a gay couple whom she denied a marriage license 10 days after the Supreme Court issued its ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges.  

She turned to the Supreme Court after an appeals court refused to grant her immunity from having to pay the $100,000 a jury awarded the couple for the emotional distress they suffered in having their right to marry denied.

The court’s Obergefell decision was among its most consequential in decades. The 5-4 ruling, written by since-retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, said the right to marry is a fundamental liberty that is protected equally for everyone, including same-sex couples, under the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection.

The Supreme Court has grown more conservative in the years since. The court’s 2022 decision overruling Roe v. Wade and eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion raised new questions about what other precedents the court might be interested in revisiting. Justice Clarence Thomas has explicitly called for the court to revisit the marriage ruling.

In her petition to the Supreme Court, Davis argued that Obergefell created a new constitutional right out of whole cloth that had ruinous consequences for religious liberty.

While some LGBTQ advocates feared the court might take the case, Davis’s petition had procedural complications that would have made it difficult for the justices to consider it. The gay couple on the other side of the litigation argued that Davis had waived her ability to seek reconsideration of Obergefell because she didn’t make that argument at earlier stages of the litigation.",1762786397.0,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1otfsud/supreme_court_declines_to_reconsider_samesex/no44cc4/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

no41r1k,politics,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"The list from the article 

**Democrats’ unity crumbled as the shutdown dragged on.**
-

For 40 days, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, kept his Democratic caucus unified as a government shutdown stretched into record-breaking territory.

But that discipline couldn’t hold forever, and it broke without Democrats achieving what they insisted was their chief demand in the fight: the extension of health insurance subsidies that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year.

The group of moderate senators who broke from their party said they could no longer hold out on a deal while Americans suffered the consequences of a shuttered government. And they cited a commitment from Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Republican leader, that they would at least receive a vote on the tax credits sometime in December.

“This bill is not perfect, but it takes important steps to reduce their shutdown’s hurt,” Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, said in a statement explaining why he backed the deal.

Still, the promise of a vote does not guarantee that legislation will be passed. In fact, any measure to address health care subsidies faces long odds in a Republican-controlled Congress and given President Trump’s frequent broadsides against the Affordable Care Act.

As a result, the deal put bitter Democratic divisions on display. Mr. Schumer tersely told reporters that he would not vote for the bill because it lacked health care provisions, and he voiced objections on the Senate floor.

House Democrats, including the minority leader, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, blasted the deal as insufficient.

“House Democrats have consistently maintained that bipartisan legislation that funds the government must also decisively address the Republican health care crisis,” he said in a statement.

Representative Ro Khanna of California went a step further, saying that Mr. Schumer “is no longer effective and should be replaced.”

“If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?” he said in a social media post.

**Health care will stay in the political spotlight.**
-

Since Republicans passed a domestic policy package earlier this year that included steep Medicaid cuts, Democrats have focused their attacks against Republicans on the issue of health care, particularly as they eye the midterm elections next year.

Their bid to win health care concessions in the shutdown deal failed. Health care premiums, at least for now, are on track to rise, at a time when Americans say they are worried about paying for medical care.

But the political silver lining for Democrats is that Republicans will now be under pressure to either embrace a measure that could bring down those costs or answer to voters who polls show are overwhelmingly in favor of doing so.

If the agreement holds and the shutdown ends, the spotlight will shift to the vote Mr. Thune has promised on whether to extend the health care tax credits, and Democrats made clear that they intend to continue to pressure Republicans on the issue.


“We are going to fight legislatively, fight back home, fight in the courts, and bring this fight in the elections,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor. “Health care costs made a major impact on the 2025 election, and they will certainly have an even greater impact on the 2026 election.”

One indicator that Democrats expect the health care fight to define the political debate to come: Every Democratic senator who is running for re-election next year opposed the shutdown deal.

The eight who backed it included senators who could afford to take a political hit, including two who are retiring, Mr. Durbin and Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. Three others — Senators John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire — are not up for re-election until 2028. And the remaining three don’t face voters again until 2030: Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia, Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Mr. King.


**Trump’s pressure tactics worked, even as voters blamed his party.**
-

Mr. Thune had been offering for weeks to give Democrats a vote on extending the health care subsidies. They only relented after the Trump administration had made the consequences of the shutdown too painful to ignore.

Asked what finally persuaded enough Democrats to break with their party, Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats and helped negotiate the deal, offered a simple answer: the harm was growing too acute.

“I think people were saying ‘We’re not going to get what we want,’” on the health subsidies, Mr. King said. “But in the meantime, a lot of people are being hurt.”

The group of people affected by the shutdown grew with each week, beyond the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been paid for weeks. The Trump administration’s legal fight to avoid paying SNAP food assistance benefits put tens of millions of Americans at risk of going hungry. And its decision to ratchet back air traffic capacity ensnared millions of others in air travel disruptions and flight cancellations that began over the weekend.

And even though polls showed that voters were generally blaming Republicans more for the shutdown — an assessment Mr. Trump said last week that he shared — a handful of Democrats ultimately decided enough was enough.

“We must extend the A.C.A. enhanced premium tax credits, but that can’t come at the expense of the millions of Americans across our country impacted by a shutdown,” Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, who backed the deal, said in a statement.


**Trump stayed on the sidelines.**
-

Presidents usually want to show that they are taking great pains to end a government shutdown, and that they will force congressional leaders to come to the table and bargain their way out of gridlock.

Not so with Mr. Trump.

The president did not once invite Democratic leaders to the White House during the shutdown to negotiate. He did not travel to the Capitol to show that he was leading the way toward a solution.

Instead, he stoked the impasse in social media posts in which he vehemently encouraged Republicans to hold the line, a message he communicated to G.O.P. senators in person at two gatherings at the White House. He cast Democrats as intransigent, and as the consequences of the shutdown mounted, he urged G.O.P. senators to find a way around them, including by ending the legislative filibuster.

As a deal was coming together on Sunday night, Mr. Trump was at a football game in Maryland, and his sole comment to reporters when he returned to the White House was: “It looks like we’re getting very close to the shutdown ending.” Still, Senator Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, said that the White House had given the deal its blessing.


**So did Republican leaders.**
-

Speaker Mike Johnson led Republicans to pass a stopgap measure to fund the government on Sept. 19. Then, he sent it over to the Senate and told his lawmakers to head back to their districts.

There they have stayed for weeks on end, as Mr. Johnson insisted that there was no reason for him or his conference to negotiate, because the House had already done its job. In doing so, he marginalized both himself and his chamber.

Mr. Thune, for his part, refused to move from his initial offer: a simple stopgap spending measure that would fund the government at existing levels. Throughout the shutdown, he maintained that Democrats were being unreasonable and that there was no reason to compromise or to tie funding the government to a health care measure.

He ultimately left it to moderates in his party to cut a deal to allow the government to reopen, often sounding more like a spectator than a leader as he professed uncertainty about exactly what deal might be possible when.

The group of negotiators included Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the Republican chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, who said she was eager to return to the regular functioning of the congressional spending process.

“Let’s get the job done and let’s do it fast,” she said.


**Democrats notched a few gains.**

The voters have spoken, but what did they say? The elections held on November 4th have consequences for how Minneapolis, New Jersey, New York City and Virginia are run; for electricity prices in Georgia and for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. They were also the first real test of whether Donald Trump’s second term is everything voters hoped for when they chose last November to send him back to the White House. Overall, Democrats did even better than expected. Yet one good night has not solved the party’s enduring problems.


Begin in New York, where a 34-year-old political novice will be handed a $117bn budget when he takes office next year. Turnout was high, suggesting enthusiasm for Zohran Mamdani and his brand of socialism. This is a big win for the oligarch-bashing left of the party. Democrats who think the answer to Mr Trump is left-wing economic populism now have a new champion. But Mr Mamdani’s victory does not answer the question of how Democrats should oppose Mr Trump, nor how they could win back power nationally. And that is because Democratic presidential candidates win New York City come what may. None has lost there since John Davis was defeated by Calvin Coolidge in 1924.

Virginia and New Jersey, which both held governors’ elections, are better places for Democrats to look for inspiration. Abigail Spanberger won in Virginia. The result was no surprise: the last time a Republican won the governorship with a Republican in the White House was in 1973. But the 15-point margin was larger than expected. The same is true in New Jersey, where polls favoured Mikie Sherrill to beat a good Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, within the margin of error. In the end she won easily. That broke a streak going back to 1961, the last time a candidate won the office after an incumbent from the same party had served two consecutive terms.


Some Democrats will look at all this and conclude that New York’s mayoral election shows that voters are fired up by the policies associated with the party’s far left; that the Democratic Party is in better shape than pundits think; and that next year’s midterm elections are as good as won. They would be making a mistake.


What are the right lessons? The first is to focus on the economy and affordability, as Mr Mamdani, Ms Sherrill and Ms Spanberger all did. The second is to pick candidates who are a good fit for the places where they are running. Ms Spanberger worked for the CIA before she entered politics and Ms Sherrill served as a Navy helicopter pilot. Both are evidence of a patriotism that helps parry Republican attacks about America-hating Democrats. The third is not to run as a defender of the establishment in an era of upheaval. New Yorkers probably do not want socialism and Mr Mamdani will be too constrained by city and state law (as well as the laws of arithmetic) to give it to them. As a year ago, this election was less an endorsement of a programme than another expression of frustration.


Landing a blow on the president after a year of introspection will give Democrats relief as they look towards the midterms next year. But when that fades, they will still face the same problems. Their party is associated with policies on immigration, climate change and race that are far from the views of the voters they need to win power nationwide. By choosing a democratic socialist as one of their standard-bearers, Democrats have just aggravated that problem. Mr Mamdani’s joyful campaign made New Yorkers feel good, but his victory could make Republican strategists feel even better.",1762376985.0,-7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1opf88d/democrats_risk_drawing_the_wrong_lessons_from_one/nnb2mwc/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

While the White House has been orchestrating much of the redistricting offensive for Republicans, the Democratic response has been more diffuse. Mr. Newsom has perhaps been the loudest voice — both in rhetoric and in action — while Mr. Jeffries has worked to use the power of his caucus to help persuade reluctant Democrats.

The day after Mr. Jeffries met with state legislators in Illinois, every Democratic member of Congress from the state released a joint statement endorsing drawing new maps in the state.

And the Democratic National Committee has been working with states and outside groups to respond both through new maps and new litigation.

“They wanted a showdown, we’re going to give them a showdown,” Ken Martin, the chairman of the D.N.C., said in an interview. “Every state that they decide they’re going to try to redistrict in, we’re going to respond in kind.”",1762182324.0,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1one2sv/with_an_eye_on_the_midterms_trump_fuels_a/nmw18kw/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

(The linked article is gifted, so you can also read their chart of what seats &amp; where). 

On a Friday morning in mid-October, Republican legislators in Indiana were summoned to a conference call with President Trump. Using a charm offensive rather than threats, the president implored the lawmakers to redraw their congressional maps to add two more Republican seats before the 2026 midterms.

The change was critical to retain control of Congress and continue his agenda, he said.

Roughly a week later, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader, was in Illinois, making the case to Democratic lawmakers that they needed to redraw their own maps to offset the growing number of newly drawn Republican districts. The main reason to take such a partisan action, Mr. Jeffries said, was to give Democrats a fighting chance in the midterm elections as Mr. Trump tried to tilt the maps in his favor.

Redrawing congressional maps ahead of a midterm election to eke out more safe seats before any votes are cast is not part of the ordinary run-up to the midterms. At such a national scale, it is a historic break from decades of settled norms regarding when and how legislative lines are drawn.

Yet this midcycle redistricting effort is at the center of Mr. Trump’s strategy to win the midterms and prevent Democratic control of the House of Representatives, which would give Democrats the power to open investigations and thwart the president’s agenda. What began over the summer in Texas, with the drawing of five new Republican-favored seats at Mr. Trump’s behest, has spiraled into a nationwide redistricting arms race.

The president’s aides and allies are supporting — or pressuring — lawmakers in nearly a dozen states to redraw maps, while Democrats are escalating their response and finding new avenues of countering the Republican effort to preserve their House majority of just a half-dozen seats. But the debate over drawing new maps has revealed fissures within both parties, as some Republicans are acting in rare defiance of Mr. Trump while Democrats are openly criticizing each other.

The result is a high-stakes partisan brawl playing out in nearly 20 states across the country, with control of Congress hanging in the balance. Critics of the practice also fear that it could open a Pandora’s box, with parties redrawing maps on a whim at any point, undercutting democratic principles.

“Everybody sees the current moment as something of an existential threat,” said Kareem Crayton, the vice president of the Washington, D.C., office of the Brennan Center, a think tank focused on democracy and voting rights. “Usually, the president of the United States is looking around the country to try to kind of come up with a way to keep things calm and predictable. And it is pretty clear on the facts that this president has been one of the instigators of all of this.”

The redrawing of legislative lines is typically done at the beginning of each decade, following the census, for the official purpose of adjusting to population changes. Both parties have used that cover to draw districts that benefit them politically, known as gerrymandering. But this year, Republicans have started that process in the middle of the decade, with the express purpose of helping them hold the House.

In making their pitch to Republican lawmakers, the president’s allies have argued their party has to act because Democrats have been aggressive in using litigation to change maps.

Martha Stewart Transformed the Dinner Party. Was That a Good Thing?

“Republicans had a choice: keep playing defense as Democrats tried to sue away the Republican House majority or go on offense,” Adam Kincaid, the executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, wrote in a text message. “Republicans chose to go on offense and proactively redraw in response to Democrats’ lawfare.”

The White House declined to comment.

Though Republicans will have more opportunities to draw more seats, it is difficult to predict which side will come out ahead in the current redistricting battle. Even if seats are drawn to give one party a clear advantage, voting patterns can be unpredictable. And each state is working on its own timeline, with some adding a single seat in a matter of days with little notice, others struggling over a single seat for weeks, and some states looking for as many as five newly safe partisan seats.

Initially, the White House saw the possibility of drawing as many as 16 new Republican seats.

So far, they have passed maps that could give them seven or more new Republican districts: five from Texas, one from Missouri, one from North Carolina and one to two from Ohio (though the Texas and Missouri maps are currently facing legal challenges). Florida, which could add two to four new seats, has formed a redistricting committee in the State Legislature, though it has not yet introduced any maps. Republicans could stand to gain additional seats with the Supreme Court poised to weaken the Voting Rights Act, though those seats might not be reapportioned until after the midterm elections.


“This redistricting war is the opening salvo of a battle that must be won,” Stephen K. Bannon, a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, said in an interview. “We must have these victories. If Trump doesn’t hold the House, they will impeach him. It will be a nightmare and a blood bath.”

But so far, Republicans’ other state efforts have not gone according to plan.

The G.O.P. leader of the State Senate in Indiana, a state where Trump officials had hoped to add two seats, has repeatedly said that he does not have the votes in the upper chamber, even as the Republican governor called for a redistricting session. Republican leadership in Kansas and Nebraska, states where the White House believed they could pick up a single district in each, have also said that they do not have enough Republican legislators on board to draw maps ahead of the midterms.

And in New Hampshire, where the White House believed they could at least make one of the state’s two districts competitive, the Republican governor, Kelly Ayotte, remains opposed, even as Corey Lewandowski, a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, threatened a primary.

Overcoming the Republican reticence in New Hampshire and the Midwestern states is critical for the White House. Vice President JD Vance has traveled twice to Indiana to lobby state leaders to support the new maps. Allies of Mr. Trump, including Chris LaCivita, his former campaign manager, have created an outside group called Fair Maps Indiana to “strongly support” redrawing maps in Indiana.

“Now the real fun begins,” Mr. LaCivita wrote on social media, in a taunting response to the Indiana Senate leader’s statement that they did not have enough votes to redistrict.

In Missouri, Republicans pushed through a new congressional map, but opponents of the plan are trying to force a referendum that would delay putting it in place until after the midterm elections. Republicans are trying to block the referendum, and the Republican National Committee has sent staff to the state to assist in that effort, according to people familiar with the effort.

Amid the Republican infighting, Democrats have found new opportunities.

At first, the only concrete plan appeared to be an effort led by California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, to change the State Constitution and draw five new Democratic seats, seeking to offset Texas’s redistricting. A referendum on the plan goes before voters on Tuesday.

But in late October, Democrats in Virginia made a surprise announcement that they planned to redistrict the state, which could net the party two or three seats. In New York, where the State Constitution inhibits Democrats in seeking to redraw maps before the 2026 elections, a leading liberal law firm filed a lawsuit challenging a Republican district in Staten Island as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, setting the stage for another potential pickup.

And a judge in Utah found that the state’s congressional map with four G.O.P. seats and no Democratic ones was unconstitutional. While the newly drawn map creates a competitive seat instead of a likely Democratic flip, Democrats are counting the new map as a victory and a seat they believe they can flip in a midterm with a president currently underwater in polling.

Yet much like Republicans, resistance among the ranks of Democrats has stalled their efforts.

In Maryland, a state under full Democratic control where Democrats could potentially draw a map to eliminate the last remaining Republican district, Bill Ferguson, the State Senate president, sent a letter to his colleagues last week, saying his chamber would not take up redistricting, citing legal concerns, a difficult timeline and a belief that “the downside risk to Democrats is catastrophic.”

“The certainty of our existing map,” he explained, “would be undermined.”

A day later, Maryland’s Democratic governor, Wes Moore, pushed back, telling reporters that “one person cannot stop a process” and that “a special session is not off the table, regardless of what anyone else says.”",1762182305.0,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1one2sv/with_an_eye_on_the_midterms_trump_fuels_a/nmw16bz/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

“I’m looking for all the help I can get, I wish there was more,” said John Green, who manages a candy store on Main Street. “For Lease” signs hang in nearby storefronts, their windows boarded up. Business has been terrible this year, Green added, even during “Elvis Week,” the annual celebration of the city’s favorite son. “People just don’t want to come here anymore.”


Downtown, where bluffs rise above the serpentine Mississippi River, George Campbell was walking his goldendoodle, Zac, when he spotted a group of National Guard soldiers in fatigues, handguns holstered at their hips. The 64-year-old psychologist said their presence had eased fears about crime.

“It’s safe. What happened? Control is what happened,” he said. “It was out of control. This is necessary.”

Trump has called Memphis “deeply troubled” and said he would “restore law and order.” The Memphis Police Department recently reported that overall crime had fallen to a 25-year low, but rates remain among the highest in the country. Forming a “Memphis Safe Task Force,” Trump dispatched more than a dozen federal agencies and departments—the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Marshals and others—and the Tennessee National Guard. The task force began operations in late September with the Guard patrols starting Oct. 10, according to the city. The troops are operating under the control of Republican Gov. Bill Lee.

**Wealth and decay**

Some officials hope the law-and-order push will ease Memphis’s reputation as crime-ridden, a stigma the city has carried for years. Leading corporations have headquarters in the city, including FedEx and AutoZone, while Elon Musk’s xAI built a major data center in Shelby County. But others have moved or closed, leaving behind empty factories and office buildings.

Memphis’s population dropped about 11% between 2000 and 2024, from 689,000 to 610,000, according to census data and estimates. Nashville, by contrast, has surged and is now the largest metro area in the state.

Parts of Memphis boast mansions and broad, manicured lawns festooned with elaborate Halloween decorations. But in other areas, graffiti covers abandoned buildings, weeds choke vacant lots and billboards advertise fentanyl-treatment programs. In one neighborhood, Orange Mound, sex workers and drug dealers ply their trades openly at midday.

In another, Frayser, stickers on a family-owned convenience store’s door warn customers: no firearms, no ski masks. A manager showed a Wall Street Journal reporter security footage of groups of men firing at each other in his parking lot. Another clip showed his clerk—a relative—cowering behind the counter as gunfire erupted outside. A shop owner next door was shot to death last year in daylight.

The manager, whose family came to the U.S. from Yemen years ago, said he had considered returning to that country because Memphis felt dangerous. Since the federal surge, however, he notices customers have stopped bringing handguns into his store, and he doesn’t hear shooting at night. He said the past few weeks are the safest he has ever felt in Memphis.


**Tourists and troops**

The National Guard can be seen downtown these days, walking in groups of five or so, accompanied by a Memphis police officer. Guard troops won’t make arrests, according to the governor’s office.

Amid the Memphis Grizzlies’ pro basketball team recent season opener, Guard troops, FBI agents, U.S. Marshals, and other authorities gathered at barricades along Beale Street, the city’s famous blues hub. They posed for photos with tourists and gave directions.

Marlon Dewey, 38, was visiting from rural Kansas for work. He came to Beale Street in part to catch a glimpse of the National Guard. “It just doesn’t feel needed,” he said. “It seems like a short-term fix to a long-term problem.” 

Gale Jones Carson, president of the Memphis Urban League, said many locals also question the use of the military. “Do we need help with the crime in Memphis? Yes, we do,” she explained. “But do we need to be invaded?” 

A group of area politicians are suing the governor, arguing the National Guard deployment violates the Tennessee Constitution. 

Lee Harris, the mayor of Shelby County, is at the forefront of the group. He supports the federal surge to help local law enforcement, but he is opposed to the arrival of the National Guard troops. (The Memphis mayor didn’t join the litigation.)


“If we get used to military personnel in our streets, we will be forever changed,” Harris said in an interview. “We may have zero crime, but we won’t be America.” The governor’s office maintains the troop deployment is on strong legal grounds.

At the picturesque University of Memphis, in a wealthy enclave, first-year student Claire Norwood, 18, feels reassured the troops are in town. Everyone here knows about Eliza Fletcher, the schoolteacher abducted and murdered while running near campus early one morning in 2022. Norwood usually stays on campus when she runs.


She hasn’t seen a National Guard soldier herself, but still, she said, “most of us feel a little safer.” 

Lee said the Guard’s role is support—freeing up law enforcement to go after criminals. At a recent press conference, he called the early data “very encouraging.”

nmurtzg,worldnews,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"**Article:** 

The Ukrainian drone zeroed in on the two Russian soldiers riding a motorcycle just after 9 a.m. on July 19, closer and closer, until it swooped down to hit its mark and the camera went dark.

It was a high-value target for the drone operator’s regiment: worth as many as 24 points, to be exact. In a real-world game run by the Ukrainian government, regiments are being rewarded with points for successful attacks.

Wound a Russian soldier? Eight points. Kill one? That is good for 12. A Russian drone pilot is worth more: 15 points for wounding one, and 25 points for a kill. Capturing a Russian soldier alive with the help of a drone is the jackpot: 120 points.

“It’s a brutal game — human lives turned into points,” said Stun, 33, a drone commander for the Ukrainian unmanned systems regiment known as Achilles. In keeping with military protocol, he goes by only his call sign.

The Ukrainian government set up the competition in August 2024, although that was more of a soft launch, a beta version. Teams compete for points to acquire Ukrainian-made gear, including basic surveillance drones and larger drones carrying powerful explosives, through an internal Amazon-style weapons store called Brave1 Market. The store first went online in April of this year and was expanded in August.

The more points a unit gets, the better stuff it can buy, ensuring that resources are directed to the teams that best use them. It is a digital-age, instant-gratification twist on time-honored rewards for soldiers like medals and promotions, with the winnings plowed back into the war effort.

Drone teams submit videos of their successful strikes to a central office in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, where experts review them to decide who gets points based on time stamps and verified destruction, said Mykhailo Fedorov, the minister of digital transformation, who helped devise the program.

Officials argue that the competition keeps troops energized after three and a half years of war, with drone operators facing constant stress from witnessing violence on live video feeds.

“This helps us stop the enemy,” said Mr. Fedorov, the digital minister. “If this gives additional motivation to our military,” he added, “we are happy to support it.”

Weaponized drones have long raised concerns that they dehumanize war by allowing soldiers to kill with the click of a button, at a remove from the battlefield. When asked if he thought that Ukraine’s drone game might be dehumanizing, Mr. Federov shrugged. “What is inhumane is starting a full-scale war in the 21st century,” he said.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, both sides have vied for a technological edge, fielding self-destructing drones, long-range drones, jet drones, fiber-optic drones, drones that intercept other drones and, soon, swarms of drones guided by artificial intelligence.

The Russians have their own version of a battlefield competition, paying bonuses like $2,400 for destroying a helicopter or $12,000 for capturing a Leopard tank.

Ukraine’s online weapons marketplace is an extension of the do-it-yourself ethos that has defined the country’s drone procurement since the start of the war, including collecting donations to buy consumer drones and hacking them to make them deadly.

More than 400 drone teams compete. Some infantry units that did not have full-fledged drone units have created them to be able to use the point system and earn equipment, soldiers said.

The contest awards points for hitting both Russian soldiers and their equipment. Demolishing a Russian multiple-launch rocket system can earn up to 70 points. Destroying a tank is worth 40 points; damaging one yields 20.

As tanks have become easy targets for drones, limiting their usefulness on the battlefield, those points have become much harder to earn.

“These days, spotting enemy vehicles is extremely rare,” said a drone pilot working with Stun who goes by the call sign Red and claims 45 confirmed kills. “And if one does show up, like coming out of a forest, there’s basically a line of drones waiting to strike it.”

The Ukrainian government has adjusted the point values to respond to Russia’s changing tactics.

For instance, as attack drones with ever-growing ranges widen and blur the front lines, the Russian Army often tries to gain ground by sending one, two or three infantrymen forward at a time. They move stealthily, trying to evade Ukrainian drone cameras by wearing anti-thermal coats or using greenery as cover. Those who succeed then regroup with any other Russian soldiers who make it forward.

So taking out Russian soldiers has become the priority.

When the competition was introduced, the death of a Russian soldier earned only two points. In October 2024, that increased to six, which was doubled in May.

Yuriy Fedorenko, the commander of the Achilles regiment, said that Ukrainian soldiers must kill or gravely injure as many as 25,000 Russian soldiers a month. That is about the number of new recruits Russia is mobilizing monthly, he added.

To do so, Ukraine needs at least two attack drones for every Russian infantry soldier, or at least 50,000 a month, Mr. Fedorenko said.

“Without exaggeration — we are cornered by Russia. Russia wants to annihilate us,” Mr. Fedorenko said, adding that he did not see the war itself as a game. “The realization that successful combat operations also bring additional equipment — that inspires confidence that we will have the means to keep fighting.”

He added that mastering drones had helped him expand his former company of 100 men into a battalion of 500 and now a regiment of about 3,000 that is considered one of the top drone units in Ukraine. Alongside other new drone regiments, Achilles is trying to form a united drone line along the front, strengthening reconnaissance, helping assault brigades in combat and blocking Russian reconnaissance drones.

A video posted in June by Robert Brovdi, the overall commander of the unmanned systems units of the Ukrainian armed forces — a new separate branch of the military supervising drones and robot warfare — shed light on the point system and the internal online marketplace where units acquire drones.

A basic kamikaze drone costs 1.3 points, Mr. Brovdi said in the video. A drone with a thermal camera runs 4.5 points. And a more advanced “vampire” drone, with up to 33 pounds of explosives and a range of up to 19 miles, takes 43 points.

Mr. Brodvi said that his former brigade, the Birds of the Magyar, had hit about 6,500 targets in May, including 2,221 Russian soldiers, earning more than 25,000 points that month. The brigade traded those points for 600 vampire drones.

So far, units across the Ukrainian military have ordered more than 80,000 drones and electronic-warfare systems using points through Brave1 Market, equipment worth more than $96 million, said Mr. Fedorov, the digital minister.

An online leaderboard lists the top 10 drone teams every month, although point totals are not made public.

In first place in September was the Birds of the Magyar, followed by the so-called Alpha Group of Ukraine’s leading internal security agency. The Achilles regiment was ranked sixth.

Both commanders and soldiers say they are already motivated to destroy Russian equipment and kill Russian soldiers. “We’re focused on destroying the enemy, on real objectives, on the mission,” Stun, the drone commander, said. “We go where we’re needed — not chasing after points.”

But they said that the contest could be motivating, spurring competition among drone operators to be the first to hit a battlefield target.

“Of course, there were times when we’d argue in chats over points,” said Stun, who was given his call sign partly because his favorite move in his favorite video game was “stun,” which freezes enemies in their tracks.

“For example, when a vehicle was hit and several units engaged it, we’d argue over who got the actual hit,” he added. “We’d say: ‘That was our target! Don’t touch it!’ ‘We were the first to hit it!’ ‘We did it! That was us!’”

Mr. Fedorov said that the game was constantly expanding to match new technology in the war. Units can now earn points for using robotic ground vehicles on logistics missions like rescuing injured soldiers, for detecting Russian equipment with reconnaissance drones and for destroying targets using guidance systems with artificial intelligence.

There are still kinks — the system is new, after all. Some unit commanders have said that the new drones did not arrive quickly enough, and some soldiers have complained that they destroyed valuable Russian equipment that was not worth any points.

The drone pilot who goes by the name Red said that his team had been lined up recently to try to hit a Russian armored vehicle, but that another team had managed to hit it first — so no points. Red’s team then turned its attention to a log raft, which is used to cross rivers, that the armored vehicle was pulling behind it.

“We burned it,” he said. “Mission accomplished. But unfortunately, no points for rafts.”",1762163466.0,149,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1on7nbw/ukraine_gamifies_the_war_40_points_to_destroy_a/nmurtzg/,,,True,"attack, death, kill",0.26999999999999996,descriptive,"violence_type=descriptive; violence type: descriptive; example windows: soldier eight points kill one that is | points for a kill capturing a russian | allowing soldiers to kill with the click | for instance as attack drones with ever | ukrainian soldiers must kill or gravely injure | at least two attack drones for every | russian equipment and kill russian soldiers we; violent_hits=7; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=1; emotional tone (many exclamation marks); violent words appear in descriptive context, not as a call to action.",False,,False
nmuq4by,worldnews,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"**Full NYT Article:**

It took less than a week for the police to track down two of the suspects who they say broke into the Louvre and made off with eight of France’s historic crown jewels. A third person, a suspected accomplice, was tracked down on Wednesday.

In all three cases, DNA was an essential part of the search.

The chief prosecutor, Laure Beccuau, said the DNA of the two men who broke into the museum and snatched $100 million worth of jewelry was found on the window and on one of the two high-powered motor scooters the thieves used to get away.

The DNA of the accused accomplice was found on the bucket of the truck-mounted mechanical ladder that was used to raise two of the thieves to the second-floor balcony of the Louvre, Ms. Beccuau said in an interview with the radio station France Info.

While the spectacular heist may have seemed like an advertisement for the lack of security at European museums, the speed of tracking the suspects was testament to the power of DNA in police investigations in France.

It is also a sign of how sloppy the thieves were in the end, after pulling off what seemed like a well-planned robbery in one of the world’s most famous museums in broad daylight. Among the objects they left behind in their haste to evade the police and security guards were a glove, a crown that they dropped, and the truck with the mechanical ladder, which they had tried unsuccessfully to set on fire.

Investigators have processed 150 forensic samples related to the crime, from the scene and from objects the thieves left behind. All three people who were arrested already had their DNA on file because of their criminal histories, mostly for theft.

“I am convinced that we would not have found these people if the DNA that was found at this theft hadn’t matched with this database,” said Gaëtan Poitevin, a criminal lawyer in Marseille whose master’s thesis was on France’s DNA database.


**How does the DNA database work?**

France’s database, the National Automated Genetic Fingerprint File, had 4.4 million DNA profiles at the end of last year. Those profiles have been collected over almost three decades from people suspected or convicted of crimes, as well as people killed in natural disasters.

It has become a staple of police investigations, with forensic investigators collecting bits of saliva, sweat, hair, skin, semen and blood, then sending them to be sequenced at public and certified private labs. The labs send the results to be compared to the contents of the enormous database, looking for exact matches.

“In just a few hours now, we can have a positive DNA result,” said Olivier Halnais, the head of the national union of forensic police officers.

**How did France’s DNA database start?**

France began its DNA database in 1998, after the serial killer Guy Georges, known as the “Eastern Paris killer” was finally arrested.

Mr. Georges had been imprisoned for assaulting a woman with a weapon, and the police collected his DNA. But France had no centralized database at the time, so officers were unable to check his DNA against that found at the scenes of five murders of women who had also been raped.


After his release from prison, Mr. Georges went on to rape and kill two more women. He was arrested again and eventually convicted of the murders of seven women. The case spurred the creation of a national DNA database.

Initially, the database contained only the DNA of sexual offenders. But, over the next five years, it grew to include people convicted — or merely suspected — of a much wider range of crimes, including murder, terrorism, drug trafficking, assault, theft and property damage.

The process of being removed from the DNA database is so onerous that few pursue it, Mr. Poitevin said. Those who refuse to give a DNA sample face at least a year in prison and a fine of at least 15,000 euros, almost $17,400.

From 2018 to 2022, an average of 680 people a year were convicted of refusing to provide DNA — less than one percent of people charged each year, according to the Justice Ministry.

“Among my clients, absolutely zero refuse, because for them, it’s an admission of guilt,” said Mr. Poitevin.

As a result, the database has continued to grow. And French investigators can check the collected DNA against more than 30 other European national DNA databases, as well as others including one kept by the United States.


**The database and cold cases**

While the databank is used regularly for basic investigations, it has proved particularly useful in cold cases.

Investigators said DNA linked Dominique Pelicot, who was convicted last year of drugging his wife, Gisele, and inviting dozens of men to rape her, to an attempted rape committed more than two decades earlier. The 1999 attempted rape case had been dormant for years until the police arrested Mr. Pelicot in 2020, collected his DNA sample and ran it through the database, matching it to long-held samples collected at the crime scene. (Mr. Pelicot has been indicted in the attempted rape.)

In 2011, a French officer investigating a nine-year-old unsolved murder used the database to search not for perfect matches but DNA profiles that were similar. That led investigators to the father of the murderer, helping solve the crime.

Such searches for direct family members are much more time-consuming and used only for serious crimes like murder or rape, said Joëlle Vailly, a sociologist who has studied how the French judicial system uses DNA.


**How is France’s system different than the U.S. one?**

The French system is very similar to the American one, called the Combined DNA Index System, which contains more than 24.9 million DNA profiles of convicted offenders and those who have been arrested, as well as 1.4 million crime scene DNA profiles.

In recent years, American law enforcement agencies have also used consumer genealogy databases, including GEDmatch or FamilyTreeDNA, which are used by millions of people with no criminal record to find distant relatives or trace their ancestry.

These commercial databases offer police a pool of partial DNA matches that they then narrow using other techniques.

The practice of using commercial databases gained renown in 2018, when detectives used one to identify a serial killer known as the Golden State Killer.

In 2022, a Canadian researcher counted more than 800 cases in which forensic genetic genealogy was used in the United States.

Three American states have passed legislation to regulate the practice, said Natalie Ram, a law professor at the University of Maryland.

Private consumer genetics companies are banned in France, in good part because the practice of tracing one’s ancestry is sensitive, Ms. Vailly said, given the country’s history. The Jewish ancestry of many French citizens was used to send them to death camps during World War II.

Last month, France’s justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, said he planned to introduce legislation to allow investigators of serious crimes that have remained unsolved for more than 18 months to access data from private foreign companies, mainly American ones, specializing in genealogical testing.

While some lawyers specializing in cold cases lauded the announcement, others called the idea hypocritical and dangerous, since such companies are outlawed in France.

Ms. Vailly, the sociologist, said she thought the practice of using forensic genetic genealogy infringed on privacy rights, as one person using a consumer genetics service would essentially be offering up the DNA of whole families, not to mention future generations, to law enforcement.

&gt; go with some combination of ""I was.."" training at altitude, sleeping in a hypobaric chamber, dealing with some exotic parasite.

Nah, he's screwed. 

He/whatever doctor he had under his employ was probably sloppy/lazy with his timings and his Z scores got him in the long run. 

You can can see and play around with the formulas WADA/UCI will use for this kind of thing and work backwards. 

https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/WADA_International_Standard_Laboratories_v.4.0_FINAL.pdf

If we look at HCT values, and yours normally sat at 50%, with a variability of 6% (living life, hydration, sleep, altitude etc all affects this), and like everyone you do a few transfusions, you play around with a little EPO microdosing...we can model out how he might've screwed himself.

Let's say over the course of 3 years you're tested 5 times, even if you're clean of any metabolites, they can still pop you for suspected doping. 

**ABP First Calculation:** 

Z score first: 

z = (x - x̄) / δ

x = your measured value (HCT in our example)

x̄ = the assigned/reference value (what the value ""should be"")

δ = the target standard deviation (the allowed variability)

According to the WADA handbook: 

|z| &lt; 2: Acceptable performance

|z| between 2-3: Questionable performance

|z| &gt; 3: Unacceptable performance


Test | HCT Result | Z-Score Calculation | Z-Score
---|---|----|----
1| 57%| (57-50)/6| +1.17
2| 58%| (58-50)/6| +1.33
3| 56%| (56-50)/6| +1.00
4| 59%| (59-50)/6| +1.50
5| 57%| (57-50)/6| +1.17


All your z-scores are between +1.0 and +1.5, and since none exceeded z = 2 you'd be fine, but: 

**ABP Second Equation:** 

RSZ = Σ(z/√m) where m = 5 tests

RSZ = (1.17 + 1.33 + 1.00 + 1.50 + 1.17) / √5

RSZ = 6.17 / 2.236

RSZ = +2.76

At +2.76 you're **DEEP** into the questionable range. Even though no individual blood test flagged as suspicious, systemically it looks to have been manipulated. 

**APB Third Equation:** 

RSSZ = Σ(z²/m)

RSSZ = (1.17² + 1.33² + 1.00² + 1.50² + 1.17²) / 5

RSSZ = (1.37 + 1.77 + 1.00 + 2.25 + 1.37) / 5

RSSZ = 7.76 / 5

RSSZ = 1.55


RSSZ = 1.55 is also elevated (below 2, so it's not as damning as RSZ), but this does indicate a long term deviation to your normal expected values. If you had more extreme swings, you'd be properly SOL. 

**If** I was a betting man, this is what I think is screwing him over. 

He tried to keep his Bio Passport under the Z score of 2 (for individual tests), so if we're using HCT above as the example, he kept it under 62%, but the RSZ caught him long term because he was never at 50% or below (at or below his baseline). 

Thus, suspicions of systematic manipulation cropped up, and he got his ban.

# Article Summary

The Democratic Party must embrace internal diversity and compete in more places rather than seek ideological purity. From 2012-2024, Democrats moved sharply left on nearly every issue while losing ground with the very voters they claimed to represent—Hispanic, Black, young, and working-class Americans. 

Social media has replaced genuine local representation with a nationalized professional political class that prioritizes online activism over electoral success. 

To build a durable majority, Democrats need to learn from candidates who win in Trump-leaning districts by emphasizing independence, recognize that internal disagreement is a strength, and rediscover the practice of genuine political engagement with people who disagree. 

The party doesn't need to move left or right—it needs to get bigger.



**The Electoral Challenge**


- Democrats face structural disadvantages requiring them to win in more places, not just win more votes overall


- Republicans control redistricting in key states, making the House harder to win


- Democrats would need to flip four Senate seats in 2026, including winning in states Trump carried by 10+ points


- The number of competitive places for Democrats has dramatically shrunk since 2010

**The Representation Problem**

- From 2012-2024, Democrats moved sharply left on virtually every issue while losing ground with the voters they claimed to represent


- Despite standing in solidarity with marginalized communities expressively, Democrats lost support among Hispanic, Black, young, Asian American, and working-class voters

- The only group where Democrats improved was college-educated white voters

- Polls show 54% of voters think the Democratic Party is too liberal, up sharply from 2012

**Social Media's Distorting Effect**

- Social media has collapsed everyone in politics into the same ""algorithmic Thunderdome,"" creating a nationalized professional political class


- Politicians now respond to online activists and donors rather than local constituents


- Expressive online politics prioritizes viral slogans and ideological purity over winning elections and passing legislation

- The professional political class has become disconnected from the voters Democrats need to win

**Historical Contrast**

- In 2010, Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act with support from pro-life Democrats like Ben Nelson and roughly 40 pro-life House members

- Joe Manchin won West Virginia by representing local voters, not national progressives, enabling passage of the Inflation Reduction Act

- Today's Democratic Party pushes disagreement outside the coalition rather than managing it inside the tent

- Successful Democrats in Trump districts like Jared Golden emphasize independence from the national party, yet face primary challenges for doing so

**The Path Forward**

- Democrats should emulate Republicans' approach of running different kinds of candidates in different places (like pro-choice Susan Collins in Maine)

- The party needs to make room for disagreement on issues like immigration, guns, trade, and climate in red and purple states

- Building genuine relationships across differences is harder than policy moderation but more important

- The solution isn't choosing between populism and moderation—it's being more things in more places

**The Threat from the Right**

- Trump's movement has broken civic norms and includes genuinely dangerous extremist elements

- However, Democrats cannot win using Trump's methods because rural overrepresentation gives Republicans structural advantages

- The country faces real danger of democratic breakdown, making preservation of liberal politics more urgent

**The Liberal Tradition**

- Historical liberalism was built on ""liberalitas""—generosity toward fellow citizens and devotion to the common good

- Liberalism's core insight: conflict is inescapable, but can bear fruit as ""argument, experiment, and exchange""

- Political division is now Americans' second-biggest concern after the economy

- Most Americans want the country to work and don't want to hate each other, creating an opening for politicians who can bridge divisions",1762077799.0,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1omcxnj/this_is_the_way_you_beat_trump_and_trumpism/nmoig1u/,,,False,,0.02,none,violence_type=none; only generic hate words in non-violent context; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=1,False,,False

nmcgauz,politics,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"**TLDR Bullet Point Summary:**

* **FDA loosens biosimilar rules:** Developers will no longer need to run expensive clinical trials to prove equal effectiveness to the original drug.
* **Goal:** Cut costs and speed up approvals for low-cost biologic alternatives (biosimilars).
* **Impact:** Expected to reduce approval time from 5–8 years to roughly half that and save developers tens of millions in costs.
* **Pharmacy flexibility:** FDA will also make it easier for pharmacists to substitute biosimilars for brand-name biologics, like they do with generics.
* **Big drugs affected:** Herceptin (breast cancer), Lantus (insulin), and Humira (arthritis) are key examples with biosimilar versions.
* **Main obstacle remains:** Brand-name drugmakers use patents and lawsuits to delay biosimilar market entry; these reforms don’t address that.
* **Market challenge:** Even after approval, biosimilars struggle for market share due to lobbying, complex pricing, and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) exclusions.
* **Industry reactions:**

  * FDA says changes promote competition and lower prices.
  * Analysts warn this doesn’t solve core bottlenecks.
  * Brand-name lobby (PhRMA) blames PBMs, not regulation, for limited biosimilar uptake.
* **Overall:** Regulatory red tape is easing, but entrenched corporate tactics may keep biosimilar prices and adoption stagnant for now.",1761905716.0,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1okqgso/fda_moves_to_speed_approvals_for_cheaper_copycat/nmcgauz/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False
nmcg563,politics,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"**Full Article:** 

The Food and Drug Administration announced on Wednesday that it would ease regulatory roadblocks for low-cost copycat versions of certain medicines.

Biosimilars, as the copycats are called, are seen as a crucial way to drive down drug prices. They are akin to generics of biologic drugs that are made through complex biological processes. Some well-known blockbuster drugs are now available as biosimilar competitors, including Herceptin, for breast cancer; Lantus, a widely used insulin; and Humira, for autoimmune conditions like arthritis.

The F.D.A. said it would advise drug developers that they generally no longer need to conduct expensive and time-consuming clinical trials aimed at showing that the copycat is just as effective as the original brand-name product. The agency also said it would push to make it easier for pharmacists to swap in biosimilars when dispensing a prescription, as is standard with generics.

“For too long, government bureaucracy and regulatory barriers have protected monopolies and stifled competition,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, said at a news conference Wednesday announcing the changes.

The Trump administration’s moves could help accelerate some biosimilars, but they stop short of addressing the most stubborn obstacles that have suppressed the copycats in the United States. The makers of brand-name drugs have used patents and lawsuits to block biosimilars from reaching the market, in some cases for years after the copycat wins F.D.A. approval. And when the copycats are introduced, they have been slow to gain market share.

“I don’t really see this regulatory change as an alleviation of the real bottleneck,” Brian Skorney, a drug industry analyst at the investment bank Baird, said on social media.

Generic and biosimilar drugs represent about 90 percent of Americans’ prescriptions, but only a tiny fraction of drug costs. The brand-name biologics that biosimilars compete with have emerged in recent years as a huge driver of drug spending.

The makers of biosimilars often spend several years and tens of millions of dollars conducting a clinical trial to show that its version is as effective as the original brand-name version. Under the F.D.A.’s proposed changes, developers would still have to show that their molecule and manufacturing process are similar.

Dr. Marty Makary, the F.D.A. commissioner, said at the news conference that the move would halve the current five- to eight-year timeline to win approval for a biosimilar. He said the changes would save biosimilar manufacturers tens of millions of dollars in development costs, saying that could be passed down in the form of lower costs for payers and patients.

Unlike traditional pills synthesized through chemistry, biosimilars are made inside living cells and typically given as infusions or injections.

When the first biosimilar was approved in 2015, there was widespread hope that the class would drastically drive down drug costs. More than 60 biosimilar products are now on the market in the United States. But biosimilars have been slow to gain traction, and drug spending has continued to increase.

In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Kennedy accused brand-name drugmakers of lobbying to stymie biosimilars to protect their profits. “The pharmaceutical industry rigged the rules,” he said.

PhRMA, the lobbying group that represents brand-name drugmakers, said in a statement on Wednesday that the real problem in the biosimilar market was different. The group blamed industry middlemen — giant companies known as pharmacy benefit managers — for often excluding biosimilars from their lists of covered medicines.",1761905633.0,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1okqgso/fda_moves_to_speed_approvals_for_cheaper_copycat/nmcg563/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

Under OFAC rules, anything owned 50% or more by a sanctioned person or company is automatically considered blocked, even if it’s renamed, spun off, or sold to a new subsidiary.

So, if Lukoil sets up “Lukoil 2.” and moves its international assets there, since owns ≥50%, it’s still blocked.

If it’s structured to look independent but controlled by Lukoil (same executives, money flow, contracts, etc), OFAC can still treat it as shadow ownership and sanction it, too. 

Then there's this excerpt from the press release: 

&gt; Furthermore, engaging in certain transactions involving the persons designated today may risk the imposition of secondary sanctions on participating foreign financial institutions. OFAC can prohibit or impose strict conditions on opening or maintaining, in the United States, a correspondent account or a payable-through account of a foreign financial institution that knowingly conducts or facilitates any significant transaction on behalf of a person who is designated pursuant to the relevant authority.

Prospective buyers risk possible secondary sanctions and being cut off from the U.S. financial system. Could be that any sale of Lukoil's assets would mean taking a massive discount to account for possible risk.

njevmxl,politics,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"\*\*Article:\*\*

Prolonged shutdowns of America’s federal government have never gone well for the party the public sees as provoking them. On all three previous occasions when a shutdown has lasted at least a week, the perceived instigators—Republicans in each case—were blamed and failed to extract any serious policy concessions. This time Republicans accuse the Democrats of holding [routine federal services](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/09/30/your-federal-government-is-now-closed-for-business) hostage. Yet so far the Democrats do not appear to be paying any political price. In fact, the earliest evidence suggests that they may even have gained a slight edge in the messaging battle.

Shortly before the shutdown began on October 1st, YouGov, a pollster, asked respondents which party they would hold more responsible if a deal was not reached. One-third of participants said the Republicans, 27% the Democrats. In the latest survey, conducted October 4th through 6th, the share blaming the Democrats rose by three percentage points, to 30%. The proportion naming the Republicans as the main culprit, however, jumped eight points to 41%. The Democrats’ net advantage over the Republicans rose from six points to 11.

Now that the shutdown is a reality, Democratic and Republican respondents have begun to move off the fence—away from blaming “both sides equally” or saying they’re “not sure”—and into their expected camps. But Democratic opinion has hardened more than Republican opinion. Some 85% of those who voted for Kamala Harris blame the Republicans, against 4% who blame the Democrats—an 81-point gap.  Donald Trump’s voters were less united to begin with: last week they blamed the Democrats more than the Republicans by a comparatively modest 51 points, a lead that has since widened to 60. Just 12% of Ms Harris’s voters now say they blame both sides equally or are unsure, compared with 23% of Mr Trump’s.

  
Demographic breakdowns tell a similar story. Among Republican-leaning groups such as men and white people, blame remains roughly evenly divided between the two parties.  Democrats, by contrast, started out with an advantage in their core constituencies and have expanded it as the shutdown wears on. Over the past week, the margin by which participants blaming Republicans exceeded those blaming Democrats rose by nine percentage points among women, 18 points among Hispanics and 22 among blacks.

Democrats may not enjoy this advantage in party unity for long. Large shares of the president’s supporters tend to embrace whatever position his administration espouses. For example, following a recent speech about physical fitness in the armed forces by Pete Hegseth, the secretary of war, 56% of YouGov respondents who recalled voting for Mr Trump said that they considered overweight generals and admirals to be a serious problem. Now the message being put forth by the administration is that congressional Democrats care more about expanding health-care benefits for undocumented immigrants than about existing government health programmes. So far it hasn’t caught on: in a separate YouGov poll just 22% of self-identified Republicans said they believe this. But if the president and his allies begin to push this message harder, that number could rise quickly.

Fortunately for Democrats, they also seem to have an edge in the middle of the electorate. Independents said they blamed Republicans more than Democrats by a margin of 41% to 17%; the margin was 31% to 18% before the shutdown began. Self-described moderates are moving in a similar direction. The Democrats’ advantage among this group has widened from 11 points (30% to 19%) last week to 22 points (39% to 17%) now. If the Democrats continue to gain ground with these constituencies, shutting down the government to force a change in policy might work for the first time.",1760428081.0,15,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1o699ad/who_do_americans_blame_for_the_government_shutdown/njevmxl/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

nirlz4s,politics,,Discarded_Twix_Bar,,"**Summary: (AI Generated for ease)**   
This discussion between Frank Bruni, Nate Silver, and Kristen Soltis Anderson paints the ongoing federal shutdown as a low-stakes political standoff with high noise but little public engagement. Both parties are unpopular and struggling to control the narrative. Democrats appear divided and inconsistent in message, while Republicans are more unified but risk being undermined by Trump’s anti-government rhetoric.

Polling shows Americans blame Republicans slightly more,though most voters simply dislike everyone involved. Public attention remains shallow since few people feel the direct effects yet. Analysts agree the outcome is unlikely to reshape long-term political dynamics — Trump’s approval remains steady, partisanship is entrenched, and messaging failures on both sides blunt any clear victory.

Ultimately, the shutdown reflects a wider political malaise:parties talking past the public, low trust in leadership, and politics driven more by symbolic fights and “meme wars” than by substance. The smart money says the shutdown will end soon, forgotten quickly, and leave the underlying dysfunction untouched.

**TL;DR bullets**

* **Public Opinion:** Voters are frustrated with both parties; no one is winning the messaging war. Slightly more people blame Republicans and Trump, but that margin is narrowing.
* **Polling Context:** Approval for all parties and leaders (Trump, Democrats, Republicans) is low and fairly static. Voters aren’t paying much attention yet, as the shutdown hasn’t deeply affected daily life.
* **Democratic Messaging:** Democrats are divided on purpose and strategy — unclear whether the fight is over health care, Trump, or principle. Their messaging lacks coherence and hasn’t broken through.
* **Republican Position:** Republicans are unusually unified this time and benefit from being seen as “in charge,” though Trump’s “shrinking government” rhetoric could undermine that.
* **Impact of Messaging:** Normal voters are disengaged; the shutdown feels like an “insider game.” Real political consequences may only come if tangible pain (missed paychecks, airport delays) emerges.
* **Trump’s Role:** His approval is steady and mostly immune to events like this. Any dips are minor and driven more by economic concerns than the shutdown itself.
* **Democratic Dilemma:** Schumer is unpopular and in a tough position—must appear strong but risks overplaying his hand. The party lacks a clear, trusted spokesperson.
* **Strategic Irony:** By fighting to preserve health-care subsidies now, Democrats may be preventing Republicans from politically self-sabotaging later.
* **“Meme Wars” and Media:** Social media hasn’t shaped shutdown narratives yet but could if visible consequences start.
* **Outlook:** Shutdown expected to last about two weeks, give or take; long-term effects likely minimal. Both parties’ leadership remains vulnerable but entrenched.
* **2027 Forecast:** GOP’s John Thune likely remains Senate majority leader; Democrats face uphill Senate math.",1760101603.0,-2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1o30240/americans_arent_happy_with_anyone_3_writers_try/nirlz4s/,,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

**Article:** 

Israeli and Hamas representatives were expected to start negotiations in Egypt on Monday in the most serious diplomatic push for a Gaza truce in recent months, as President Trump sought to advance his ambitious vision for the territory.

The two sides, who refuse to speak directly, will rely on Qatari, Egyptian and American mediators to ferry messages back and forth in an attempt to bridge significant gaps.

U.S. officials have expressed optimism that part of Mr. Trump’s plan could be achieved quickly: a Hamas release of hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and an Israeli withdrawal from parts of Gaza.

But even with Mr. Trump pressuring both sides to reach a deal quickly, analysts cautioned that persistent sticking points could sink the chances for a diplomatic breakthrough.

Tuesday marks two years since the war began, ignited by the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The two sides have been negotiating for most of the past two years without reaching an agreement to end the war.

Israelis and Palestinians are experiencing a mix of emotions, from hope to disbelief to anxiety, over the developments of the past week, which could end the war — or lead to another disappointing dead end.

**What does the Trump plan envision?**

After months of deadlock, Mr. Trump presented a sweeping plan last week to end the fighting and free the remaining hostages. At least 20 living hostages and the bodies of about 25 others are believed to still be in Gaza.

Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 people, including thousands of children, according to local health officials. The Hamas-led attack on Israel that started the war killed roughly 1,200 people, and about 250 were taken hostage.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has said he backs Mr. Trump’s plan. On Friday, after Mr. Trump leveled an ultimatum to Hamas to agree to the deal, the Palestinian militant group announced that it was prepared to release all of the hostages under the terms of the plan.


But Hamas’s response was vague on many of Mr. Trump’s other demands. Mr. Trump’s proposal would see Hamas lay down its weapons, for example, which Hamas’s statement did not address.

Mr. Trump said Hamas’s answer showed it was “ready for a lasting PEACE” and exhorted Israel to immediately stop bombing Gaza to allow the deal to advance. Israel ordered its troops in Gaza focus on defensive rather than offensive operations, according to Israeli officials.

The negotiations in Egypt will focus on the first part of Mr. Trump’s plan: freeing remaining hostages in exchange for Israel’s release of Palestinian prisoners and withdrawal from parts of Gaza.

In Mr. Trump’s proposal, the hostages would be exchanged for 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences for militant activity and 1,700 Gazans detained during the war. Each dead Israeli captive would be exchanged for the bodies of 15 Gazans.

Israeli forces will also withdraw to an agreed-upon line, but still be inside Gaza’s borders.

Mr. Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that Israel will not accept any agreement in which Hamas refuses to surrender its arms.

“This will happen either diplomatically, according to Trump’s plan, or militarily — at our hands,” he on Saturday, adding, “This will be achieved the easy way or the hard way, but it will be achieved.”

**What are the biggest sticking points?**

Mr. Trump’s proposal, which will form the basis for the talks in Egypt, can broadly be divided into two parts: the hostage release deal and the vision for postwar Gaza. Both are full of potential stumbling blocks that could torpedo a deal.


One major issue will be how far Israeli forces withdraw during the initial phase, when Hamas is to hand over the hostages. Another issue will be how long Hamas has to gather the hostages and the bodies of the dead. Under Mr. Trump’s plan, it would return them all within 72 hours of the cease-fire.

Israeli and Hamas officials have both said that deadline could be unrealistic and the group needs more time, particularly to find and dig up hostages who were killed.


The two sides will likely disagree over which Palestinian prisoners would be released. Hamas could demand that Israel place senior Palestinian leaders, such as Marwan Barghouti, on the list, but Israel would be reluctant to accept.


Even if Israel and Hamas work out the details of the exchange, it is unclear whether Hamas is willing to accept many of Mr. Trump’s postwar conditions.
Under the American plan, Hamas would have to disarm, which it has refused to do in the past. The proposal calls for an international security force, which Hamas officials have rejected as foreign meddling in Palestinian affairs.


If Hamas freed the hostages before working out those details, the group would be giving up what it views as its main leverage with Israel.

Efforts to halt the fighting in Gaza have previously ended in frustration. Israel and Hamas have agreed only to temporary cease-fires before: for about a week in November 2023 and for less than three months earlier this year.

**Who will be negotiating in Egypt?**

The negotiations in Egypt are planned in Sharm al-Sheikh, a tourist resort on the Red Sea. They will likely involve representatives of Israel, Hamas, Egypt, Qatar, and the United States.

1pd04dy,AmItheAsshole,,Due_Knowledge4108,AITA for not inviting grandmother to child’s school event,"My child (17) has an end of school dinner/celebration. They aren’t finishing school for good, however that particular school finishes at their current grade and the whole grade are changing schools next year, hence the end of school event. 
My child (who has a few social issues and has had a very rough year) didn’t want any parents attending at all however school rules state the students must attend with a parent/carer/significant adult (they can bring a maximum of two). I didn’t want to go alone so encouraged my child to think of someone else to invite. They don’t have much contact with their dad at the moment, so I suggested one of their grandparents (one of my parents). My child was adamant they didn’t want anyone else to come. Days later I asked again and my child told me I could ask a specific family friend knowing that person would be good company for me on the night. However now my mother (child’s grandmother) is very upset that she 
wasn’t asked and that someone from outside the family has been asked. My mother is talking about the event as a graduation and is hurt that she doesn’t get to attend her first grandchild’s graduation. I never thought of the event in the same way and as such haven’t attached the same meaning to it and therefore didn’t think that who was asked would be a big deal. I was trying to make the event as easy as possible for my child and for me (I don’t know any other parents at the school). When my mother told me how hurt she was I did ask her to come but she now doesn’t want to as she wasn’t the first choice. 
I have two questions: 
1) AITA for not considering her feelings in this; 2) should I now just deal with the awkwardness of going alone so that we’re not taking someone that isn’t family",1764755505.0,25,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pd04dy/aita_for_not_inviting_grandmother_to_childs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pd04dy/aita_for_not_inviting_grandmother_to_childs/,,False,,0.05,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0; intense tone (many ALL CAPS words),False,,False

I’ve worked hard to manage it, and you wouldn’t know if I didn’t tell you. My husband (43 M) is very close with his family. His parents live 6 hours away, and 2x a year we go down for big family gatherings. We usually stay 5 full days plus 2 travel days. We used to stay at his aunt’s, but now we stay with his parents. They have two extra bedrooms: one closed-door room that my brother-in-law and his wife use, and the other is a loft where my husband and I sleep. The loft has no door. You can’t see into it, but you can hear everything. My husband snores, sometimes so loud that at home I end up in our spare room. When we visit, there is constant socializing. We go house to house with the same large extended family all day. My social battery drains fast, and I take alone walks to avoid getting overstimulated. I love his family. But I have a very hard time sharing bathrooms. I deal with severe constipation and get extremely self-conscious spending so much time in someone else’s bathroom. My in-laws have one common bathroom and another inside their bedroom, which they don’t mind people using, but I feel awkward going in there. My MIL also has a chronic cough that’s much worse in the mornings. For the past few years, sleeping there has been incredibly difficult..between my husband’s snoring and her coughing, I’m awake multiple times a night/morning. She tries to stay in her room longer so she doesn’t wake us, but because the loft has no door, every sound travels. I use earplugs and a noise machine, and I still get jolted awake. The TV room is directly under the loft, so once people wake up, I hear everything. My husband tells me I can “go up to the loft” for alone time, but that feels strange when we’re there to visit. At home I need quiet time after social events to decompress. On these trips, I get almost no alone time and barely any real sleep. My anxiety spirals. I want to enjoy visiting his family. I have a stressful job and limited vacation time, and I use a big chunk of it for these visits. I come back more drained than when I left. So I asked my husband if I could get a hotel room just to sleep. The hotel is less than two miles away. I’d spend the whole day with his family, but at night I’d have quiet, a bathroom I can actually use, and the ability to mentally “turn off.” When I brought it up, he said: “You’re not getting a hotel room, that’s ridiculous,” and “Do you know how hurt my parents would be?” He told me I “need to get over this stuff.” His solution was sleeping in the walk-in closet, which is even more ridiculous. He says he wants me there as his wife, but I need him to consider my mental and physical health. When I don’t sleep, everything suffers. AITA for spending a few nights (not xmas Eve) in a hotel so I can actually sleep and, honestly, poop in peace? I’m looking for outside perspectives on how to do this without offending his family while still taking care of myself.
