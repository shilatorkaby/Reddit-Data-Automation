I say this as a girl who doesn't want to get judged by 'good for nothing' aunties about my height, my weight, the color of my skin, the clothes that I wear or my f'ing breast size. I say this as a girl who wants to not lie to her closest friends about her own cast. I say this as a girl whose own mother says a girl shouldn't look too bad that her husband feels embarrassed to take her in social settings or that people feel so disgusted that they are not able to swallow their food but a girl shouldn't look too good either because than she attracts unwanted attention and people don't look at her in the wrong way. I say this as a girl who wants nothing much from life but the bare minimum but is labelled as the girl who is too ambitious or high maintenance, too woke or too western for the Indian culture. I say this because the only way I knew how to escape this was to study hard and earn enough money to just leave everything behind. But now I know that no matter how well educated you are, or how rich you are, you cannot escape society and everyone will judge everyone. Even me who wants so much, will find myself judging others because they had the audacity to judge me (or express their thoughts as the people today like to call it).",

    "selftext":"(Throwaway account, Flair just to be safe)\n\nHello. I've (21m) been wanting to write this post for some time, simply to express some of my frustrations to someone, even if it is just to random people on the internet.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I made the worst mistake of my life. I got behind the wheel of my car, knowing I had probably had one drink too many. The time leading up to the incident had been the worst period of my life. I was miserable. I felt very alone. I hated myself, my looks, my personality, you name it. It had been about a year since I finished school, and I was just spiraling. Even though on the outside, it might've looked like my life was great. I had an amazing job for a very young age (19 at the time). I had a very nice car, I was financially stable, everything was great. Except it just wasn't.\n\nI, to this day, still don't know for sure why I was so down for so many months. One thing I do know is that I was likely very overworked. I was working about 50-60 hours a week, with an additional 10-12 hours driving to and from work. I was working a (high level for my age) management position for a big retail company in my country. Actually, I was working two management positions, since my supervisor was on maternity leave. This meant I handled the duties of 2 management positions, managing about 20 people at an age of 19-20. I am only writing about my work, because I simply do not know the reason for my misery at the time. I will say I was a little heartbroken at the time, but nothing I felt I couldn't handle. And as I mentioned, a lot of things were going \"well\" in my life. I know all this doesn't excuse my mistake, but this is the only logical explanation I have. I was drinking quite a lot at the time, I guess to escape from reality.\n\nBut then came that one night. I had been drinking, and I made the horrible decision to drive my car. Luckily, no one was hurt. I was parking my car when the police pulled me over. They had me blow into a breathalyzer, and then took me to the hospital to get a blood test, then to the police station. I was a mess. At least in my mind. I was pretty much dead on the outside, but my brain was screaming in disappointment. Somehow, the night it happened, my mom knew. I came home very tired, very defeated. She asked me: \"Is something wrong? Did something happen?\". She clearly knows me well. If nothing was wrong (or not wrong enough that I would wanna talk about it), I would've answered immediately, however, of course I would have to tell her about this. Before I could even speak, she asked: \"Did you drive? Did you get pulled over drunk?\". I have no idea how she knew. She didn't react well of course, but she also didn't scold me either. I guess she could tell I knew how stupid it was. Two months later, I got mail from the police, stating my BAC was just over the legal limit. In my country (for good reason) the laws on driving under the influence are quite strict. I had 14 days left to drive, before I would be banned from driving for 3 years. I also had to pay a fine of about 3000\u20ac. I was devastated. From the day it happened, I didn't eat, didn't sleep, didn't talk to my friends. The only reason I saw my friends for the two months waiting time was because one of my close friends was graduating. To this day, not even all of my family knows about it. I am simply too ashamed to tell them, and I know my grandma would kill me if she found out. I had to quit my job and find something else. Had to sell the car (which my parents were willing to buy, bless them). My entire life was pretty much crumbling before my eyes. Yet my parents were quick to help me. Figure out ways to make it work. I had given up on everything the day I received that letter. I was ready to end it. I felt like I lost everything with my drivers license. I lost my faith, masculinity, everything I had worked for. Although after about 4 weeks of feeling sorry for myself. I got back to work, and I was starting to get better. Somehow picking myself up, and trying to come to terms with my life.\n\nThis was the worst decision of my life. I am not the criminal type. I come from a good family, a good upbringing, and I have no one else to blame but myself. I live with this decision now. The thing I struggle with the most is the shame and the guilt. I will tell myself I deserve to feel this way, and I am constantly waiting for people to tell me this as well. However, somehow, this never happens. My closest friends laugh about it and make jokes (in good spirit, I am good with it). I was prepared to lose friends, because I thought people would think much worse about me. However, people are suspiciously nice about it. This is what I struggle with. I tell myself when I'm cycling to work in the pouring rain, that I deserve this. I did this to myself. I am pretty much the only person to shame myself over this, and I don't understand. \n\nWhen I lost my drivers license, I lost a lot of my confidence. Dating was completely off the table. I felt, and still feel, completely emasculated. Which I feel is stupid, but I feel it anyway. I am unable to take anyone on dates, pick people up, make plans etc. However, my experience with dating (since it kind of just happened inevitably), feels so weird. The girls I have dated have been good with it. They have even respected me for telling them (Thank you Cecilia). And I simply don't understand. In my eyes, my worth as a partner is lower because of my inability to drive, and also the fact that I have made that kind of mistake. Also, I am not just so hot that whatever crime I could have committed, doesn't even matter. I am an average dude. Even the girl I am dating now seems to have no problem with it, stating that I am not a burden at all, even when I feel like it because she has to drive us everywhere. I dread having to make plans with her, because I cannot take her anywhere. She has to drive. I have even sometimes insisted taking the bus or cycling to dates, even in the very cold winter. She calls me an idiot for it, insisting on picking me up, and I end up insisting to pay for gas and \"burdenmoney\". I feel like I can't be a proper boyfriend, and it is boring a hole in my brain, to the point where I am considering ending it, simply for this reason. Her parents also don't know, and they have apparently been asking her why I'm not picking her up, since somehow they know I used to drive. I don't know how I would go about telling them, and I am deathly afraid of telling them. Who would want their daughter to date some idiot who got a DUI?\n\nI don't understand. I feel so much shame and guilt all the time. I dread having to tell people, yet their reaction is always surprisingly positive. Even when I told my old boss, he simply felt sorry for me, even making plans for how we would make it work with the bus times. It was just too far to make it work every day. I have felt for some time, that I would not be able to start life properly again, until I got my drivers license back. I have tried my best. Making it work where I can, but sometimes, it really fucking sucks. I have some days where I am very mean to myself because of it, but I do try to avoid this. Therapy isn't really an option for me, simply because in my country, it is very expensive and there is a waitlist of 2-3 years anyway. I don't know what I wanted with this post. It just feels good to get it out of my system I guess. I still walk around with shame every day, but I guess it does become a routine to just get on the bike every day instead. I feel like it is something I live with. Not something that gets better day by day. I am simply waiting for the 3 years to be up.",

He initiated several 'investigations' over the community in order to prevent it from going forward. I imagine if he can tie a single person from that community to CAIR he'll shut everything down.

    "selftext":"&gt;The deal overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane would require members of the Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7 billion over 15 years. The new agreement replaces one that the U.S. Supreme Court rejected last year, finding it would have improperly protected members of the family against future lawsuits.\n\nThat \"up to\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting. \n\n&gt;There\u2019s no mechanism for tracking where it all goes or overarching requirement to evaluate whether the spending is effective. \n\nThat's cool. I'm sure bullshit non-profits won't spring up just to get a cut of the $50B only to close after a local news program asks why they need a Range Rover. \n\n&gt;Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue\u2019s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.\n\nOK, that's something.",

He has long been active in the Federalist Society, and is a contributor who has frequently spoken at the organization's events in Texas. According to his critics, O'Connor has become a \"go-to\" favorite for conservative lawyers, because, they claim, he reliably rules against Democratic policies and for Republican policies. Attorneys General in Texas appear to strategically file cases in O'Connor's jurisdiction so that he will hear them.\n\nOn March 26, 2015, O'Connor enjoined the federal government's definition of marriage as it relates to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.He dissolved the injunction following the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.\n\nIn early 2018, O'Connor held the Certification Rule of the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional in Texas v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, concluding that it violated the nondelegation doctrine. This ruling was reversed on appeal.\n\nIn 2018, O'Connor ruled that the Indian Child Welfare Act was unconstitutional. The Fifth Circuit reversed O'Connor's ruling on appeal, and the reversal was upheld by the Supreme Court in Haaland v. Brackeen (2023).",

I was never the first choice of anyone, I wasn't known for anything, nobody laughed at my jokes, nobody praised me for something, nobody gave me attention for anything I have done no matter how much I tried to do a favor to someone. \n\nWith this reflex, I tried to be nice. I accepted everybody, cared for those I stood around convincing myself that they were friends. What has that created? A boxing bag, which is myself. They pretended I was a softie, took advantage of my favor.\n\nI hate everybody that use one other as a step to take to get attention. The things I want to do to those bullies break both the geneva convention and the Rule 5.\n\nI really can't do anything. My mother, my father prevents me. They are a wall inbetween me and my freedom. I can't punch that bully in the face and kick his face inwards because my parents will get mad, I can't be nice to anybody, I can't just be a tail behind someone I see as a friend, and the worst of all is that I can't be anyone known, nobody helps me, my life is worthless as my name is, now I am 17. 2-4 years, and I am no longer free. For the college I must go even though I don't want is ready to swallow me whole into the horrors of maths and useless fucking academics. \n\nWhy can't I be anyone known? Why was I born in this century? Why couldn't I be anywhere close to miyamoto musashi? Why wasn't I given a chance to prove I exist? \n\nWhy am I so pathetic? Did God will for me to be this way? Why? \n\nI'll live like a dog and die for nothing. That's what. ",

    "selftext":"edit: sara is in clubs and already talks to a counselor, who basicallly gave the same advice of put herself out there\n\nthe friend group fell apart because of boy drama\n\nedit2: people keep asking why she doesn\u2019t want Sara to join. The answer is she doesn\u2019t want to be the twin package anymore. She wants her own friend, she wants to be independent.\n\ni can\u2019t force them to sit together because that would make resentment. I can give a conversation about empathy witch i will do but it will not be a guilt trip becuase she Is allowed to say no to sitting with someone.\n\nMaybe sit with her once and while at lunch would be good. Not all siblings are best friends and people treating them as the as a package  is the reason they are not close to begin with\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis is about my two girls ( twins) that are in freshman year of high school. I will call them Sara and Mia. During elementary school they were basically always\u00a0\u00a0together. Middle school Mia started to feel resentment about always being with Sara so the school tried to split them up as much as possible. This was hard because the classes were not big. I made it a point to have activities that were just there own.\n\nMia got really into sport and Sara into theater. This seemed to help and we did more seperating. They got their own birthday parties and not a shared one for example. Mia really thrived with this but Sara did not. It has been a lot harder for Sara to be her own person ( Mia was always the dominate\u00a0\u00a0twin when they were together)\u00a0\n\nHigh school was a big change and for the first time they were completely separate, no shared classes. Sara has been having difficulties and it got worse this past month. The friend group she was hanging out with broke up and she has been sitting alone at lunch.\u00a0\n\nSara asked Mia to sit together with her friend group at lunch and Mia told her no. This resulted in in a big fight between the two. Mia point was these were her friends and Sara need to learn to make her own and basically not piggyback off Mia. Sara point was they were twins and she is sad sitting alone.\n\nI told Sara very gently that Mai doesn\u2019t have to sit with her at lunch and encouraged her to keep trying to make friends, and basically put herself back out there\u00a0\n\nSara has been crying since and my ex is giving me an earful. I don\u2019t know if I made the right call on this",

    "selftext":"6 months ago, I went out drinking, blacked out, and woke up the next morning with the worst hangover of my life. At least, I thought I was just hungover. Until I looked in the mirror and noticed a swollen lump on my forehead. I don\u2019t remember what caused my injury, but in my drunken state, I had sustained a concussion.\n\nThe next few weeks were torture. My cognition was markedly slowed down, I had no control over my emotions, and my entire nervous system was completely out of whack. I went to the doctor, and there was little they could do besides tell me to eat healthy, exercise to the best of my ability, and get quality sleep.\n\nDaily severe headaches made normal functioning impossible. Eventually I was referred to a physical therapist to help with neck issues, as most concussion injuries also cause whiplash or other neck problems. It didn\u2019t really help.\n\nOver the next few months, some of my symptoms subsided. Headaches come and go, and my cognition is back to 80-90% of where I was before. But my body is still carrying so much trauma. I\u2019m stuck in fight-or-flight all the time. Panic attacks with no obvious trigger are a frequent occurrence. I\u2019m trying to do everything right, I should be fully recovered by now, my initial injury wasn\u2019t even that bad. Everyone else thinks I'm completey back to normal, but I'm barely holding it together.\n\nI feel like a shell of myself. I can't imagine living the rest of my life like this, but at this point, I think this is as good as it gets.\n\n",

I showed up, got ignored, talked over, snapped at, and looks of disdain from my Aunt, Sister and Grandmother. \n\nWell I left to walk the dog with my grandpa and while i was gone, my aunt, let's call her Vicky, cornered my bf, Tyler, and started asking intrusive and inappropriate questions about my life, my choices and my body and making commentary about my late mother and how she ruined me from having a good relationship with the rest of the family.

    "selftext":"Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik, a prominent ally of President Trump, criticized House Speaker Mike Johnson, calling him an ineffective leader who is losing control over the GOP conference headed into the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cHe certainly wouldn\u2019t have the votes to be speaker if there was a roll-call vote tomorrow,\u201d the New York lawmaker, who is running for governor, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \u201cI believe that the majority of Republicans would vote for new leadership. It\u2019s that widespread.\u201d\n\nThe comments came Tuesday night as Stefanik was publicly sparring with Johnson over a legislative provision she wanted included in the annual defense-policy bill. On Wednesday morning, Stefanik said she had a \u201cproductive discussion\u201d with Johnson and Trump and that her provision would be added to the bill.\n\nJohnson, who easily survived a challenge to his speakership last year, struck a conciliatory tone after their discussion, telling reporters Wednesday that he thought the matter was resolved. \u201cI never understood what all the disturbance was about,\u201d he said, attributing the dispute to a breakdown in communication.\n\nIn the Journal interview, Stefanik painted Johnson\u2019s standing with Republicans as in a state of collapse. She cited matters ranging from members criticizing his decision to keep lawmakers in their home districts during the recent government shutdown, to weak showings in special elections and to what she casts as his failure to address the expected jump in healthcare costs if the party doesn\u2019t reach an agreement with Democrats soon.\n\nIt is the most critical Stefanik, 41 years old, has been of Johnson since the Louisiana congressman rose to the speakership in late 2023 following the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.). Johnson has led the chamber with razor-thin margins, successfully passing Trump\u2019s tax bill in the summer. But more recently, four Republicans joined Democrats in forcing a vote on releasing files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, over the strong initial objections of Johnson and Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all bubbling over,\u201d said Stefanik, whose congressional probe into antisemitism on college campuses led to the resignations of multiple Ivy League presidents two years ago. \u201cWhereas Kevin McCarthy was a political animal, Mike Johnson is a political novice and boy does it show, with the House Republicans underperforming for the first time in the Trump era.\u201d\n\nShe also discounted Johnson\u2019s closeness to Trump and argued that the president \u201cis the leader of the Republicans and he certainly doesn\u2019t need Mike Johnson.\u201d\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nJohnson allies said they were bewildered by Stefanik\u2019s criticism. \u201cI don\u2019t know why she\u2019s choosing this moment to go after Mike,\u201d said Rep. Pat Fallon (R., Texas). \u201cHe\u2019s honest, he\u2019s caring. He truly is the man that he reports himself to be.\u201d\n\nRep. Richard Hudson (R., N.C.), chairman of House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, said Johnson \u201chas been a fantastic leader for our conference from a political standpoint,\u201d with a strong fundraising record. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve asked him to do, he\u2019s far exceeded,\u201d he said.\n\nStefanik began lashing out at Johnson in recent days over the provision she wanted attached to the annual defense authorization bill that Congress is pulling together. The provision, which she has been working on for years, would require Congress to be notified if the Federal Bureau of Investigation probes candidates running for president and other federal offices. She said on social media that Johnson was \u201cgetting rolled by House Dems attempting to block my provision.\u201d\n\nJohnson told reporters Tuesday that he wasn\u2019t aware of any problems with the provision until Stefanik complained about it and that the proposal was being addressed through normal committee processes. \u201cI don\u2019t exactly know why Elise won\u2019t just call me,\u201d he said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t even on my radar.\u201d He said he would work to fix the situation.\n\nStefanik fired back on social media that his comments were \u201cjust more lies.\u201d She also signed onto a discharge petition led by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R., Fla.) designed to bypass GOP leadership and force a vote on a ban on congressional stock trading, a move that raised eyebrows within the GOP conference. Some questioned what her strategy was in going after the speaker.\n\nOther Republicans have made jabs at Johnson. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that House leadership is refusing to do anything about congressional insider trading,\u201d Rep. Greg Steube (R., Fla.), who has also been critical of party leaders in the past, wrote on X as he voiced support for the stock-ban push. \u201cIf the Speaker and Majority Leader won\u2019t step up and do the right thing, we will.\u201d\n\nBefore the president\u2019s tax bill was passed, about two dozen Republicans warned that Johnson was losing trust with some in his conference. During the shutdown, a handful of Republicans such as Rep. Kevin Kiley (R., Calif.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.) criticized Johnson\u2019s strategy for keeping House members home, though other Republicans backed the approach.\n\nDespite the criticism, Johnson has also enjoyed support from the hard-line House Freedom Caucus\u2014which has fought with leadership in the past\u2014and a large faction of the party during the shutdown. He gets praise from many members for his cool demeanor, even amid turbulent times or when facing criticism from within his own party. Some lawmakers play down the results in recent special elections that have shifted toward Democrats, saying they don\u2019t necessarily indicate how Republicans will fare in the coming year.\n\nStefanik, who came to Congress in 2015, has had a topsy-turvy year. She was the top ranking woman in GOP leadership when she was nominated by Trump to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. But her nomination was scratched after Trump and Johnson grew nervous about the GOP\u2019s thin House majority, with the concern peaking during two special elections in Florida. Stefanik stayed in Congress and with a lesser leadership title\u2014because her past post had already been filled\u2014then announced her campaign for New York governor.\n\nStefanik alleges that Johnson opposed her nomination. Johnson allies contend that he only warned Trump to keep an eye on the GOP\u2019s thin margin when plucking members from the House to serve in the administration and that the speaker backed her nomination once it was announced. They also note that Johnson, despite Stefanik\u2019s criticisms at the time, worked to reinstall her in a leadership position and help her restore her seniority on the House Intelligence Committee.",

    "selftext":"Volkswagen engineers in one of China\u2019s electric-vehicle hubs are looking to the country\u2019s automotive industry for clues about how to speed up manufacturing and beat back local rivals in the world\u2019s biggest auto market.\n\nThe German automaker has long been the number one manufacturer in a market dominated by gasoline-powered vehicles, but it has been losing market share as China\u2019s market turns electric. It is now trying to figure out how to compete with upstart Chinese makers that can roll out good, affordable and highly digital electric cars\u2014and do so in a third less time.\n\nNissanMotor is similarly trying to produce cars faster by deploying tips it learned from a Chinese joint venture. Toyota Motor is bringing in engineers from its Chinese partnerships to better develop electric and smartcars.\n\nThe moves highlight a significant turnaround in the politically sensitive, employment-heavy auto industry. Whereas China once struggled to match, much less master, Western know-how in engines and drivetrains, it is now Western companies that need to learn from China.\n\nThis shift carries implications, not just for China\u2019s market\u2014where domestic carmakers account for around three-quarters of EV and plug-in hybrid sales\u2014but also on global manufacturers\u2019 home turf. China\u2019s EV manufacturing methods, suppliers and digital technology could permeate global carmakers.\n\nTo head off what could become an onslaught of cheaper, sleeker Chinese electric vehicles, the U.S. has steep tariffs and the European Union is investigating Chinese subsidies to EV makers.\n\nIn the past, Volkswagen made cars in Europe and brought them into China with some adjustments, said Ralf Brandst\u00e4tter, who heads Volkswagen\u2019s China business. That approach no longer works because customer requirements in the electrified and more digital China market have become too different.\n\n\u201cWe need to be more agile and focused,\u201d he said last week at Volkswagen\u2019s EV production, development and procurement hub in Hefei, west of Shanghai. The company will develop cars for China in the country while working with Chinese partners and making more decisions locally, he said.\n\nThe changes will help Volkswagen\u2019s goal of being among the top three carmakers in China in 2030, Brandst\u00e4tter said.\n\nThat is a downsized ambition for a company that has been leading car sales in China for decades. Homegrown BYD is chasing down its lead through sales of its pure electric and hybrid vehicles.\n\nSome global automakers are already retreating or resetting their course. Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Motors is ending production in China, while Jeep-maker Stellantis stopped producing vehicles in China. Ford Motor pulled the plug on its electric car direct-sales business.\n\n**Volkswagen turns to Chinese suppliers**\n\nFor Volkswagen, pulling back isn\u2019t on the table. China is its biggest market, accounting for around 40% of vehicle sales.\n\nThe German automaker\u2019s grip started to loosen several years ago, as it struggled to produce popular electric vehicles.\u00a0\n\nVolkswagen takes a little less than four years to get a new product to the market, while Chinese companies are able to do so in a little more than 2\u00bd years, Brandst\u00e4tter has said. Now it is aiming to cut its vehicle development process to about 2\u00bd years, he said.\n\n\nThat would be achieved through a bundle of actions, some of which are inspired by the Chinese way.\n\n\nOne is to use more Chinese components obtained from speedy local suppliers, rather than relying on German ones. From display and media systems to EV batteries and headlights, Volkswagen said sourcing these items from Chinese suppliers will cut development time by roughly 30% and costs by between 20% to 40%.\u00a0\n\n\nChinese suppliers have significantly improved in quality, durability and technology in the last four years or so, Volkswagen executives said.\u00a0\n\nLocal suppliers work with leading domestic carmakers and are a major part of China\u2019s electric and intelligent vehicle ecosystem, which industry executives and experts say is a head above the rest.\u00a0\n\n\nVolkswagen is also investing billions of dollars in local companies to get its hands on cutting-edge Chinese technology. Those include Chinese EV startup XPeng and battery maker Gotion High-Tech as well as Horizon Robotics, which makes automotive software and chips focused on autonomous driving, and ThunderSoft, which makes operating systems and software for smart cockpits.\u00a0\n\nVolkswagen has also made management structure changes to move faster. At Hefei, the team will have the authority to approve components locally to save time going back and forth with headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany.\u00a0\n\nThe team in Hefei is developing a new electric-vehicle platform for entry-level cars for the China market, set to be launched in 2026. By 2030, the carmaker plans to offer 30 electric models in China.\n\n**Nissan tries to break the mold**\n\nNissan is also trying to speed things up to reverse sliding sales. It has picked up a few tips from Venucia, a local brand by Nissan and its Chinese joint venture partner Dongfeng Motor. One of those is how to move more quickly with vehicle testing.\n\n\nTraditionally, Nissan waited months for some molds to be completed before using them to build test vehicles, a person with knowledge about the matter said. Now in China, the Japanese carmaker is in the process of using prototype molds instead.\n\nTo ensure quality, Nissan simultaneously plans to use more digital technologies, such as 3-D printers or virtual testing, to conduct additional tests, the person said. By 2026, Nissan plans to release under its badge four EV and plug-in hybrid models in China, developed at its R&amp;D center in the country, as well as six more under local badges with its joint venture.\n\n\nA Nissan spokesperson said that the company acknowledges its joint venture has built strong capabilities, and that any testing meets Nissan\u2019s global standards.\n\n\nToyota has shifted the focus of its China R&amp;D center to electric and smartcars, and is bringing on more engineers from its joint ventures for projects there.\n\n\nLike Volkswagen, Toyota said in July that it would seek local suppliers, is revising component design and upgrading its production and manufacturing technology to cut costs in intelligent electric vehicles.\n\nMany foreign brands fell behind in product cycles in China because they didn\u2019t prepare early enough for the electrification trend that took off around 2020\u2014and to catch up will take years, said Bill Russo, CEO of Automobility, a Shanghai-based strategy firm.\n\nFor now, many may have to rely on cost cutting and price discounts to boost sales, he said.",

    "selftext":"WASHINGTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Investigators led by the FBI's joint terrorism task force sought clues on Thursday to what drove an Afghan immigrant to open fire on two National Guard soldiers mere blocks from the White House in what officials called an \"ambush\" attack on Thanksgiving eve.\n\n\nThe two soldiers, part of a militarized law enforcement mission ordered by President Donald Trump months ago and challenged in court by officials of the District of Columbia, were hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nThe suspect, who was wounded in an exchange of gunfire before he was arrested, was identified by the Department of Homeland Security as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national.\n\n\nTrump, who was at his resort in Florida at the time of the attack, released a prerecorded video statement late on Wednesday calling the shooting \"an act of evil, an act of hatred and an act of terror.\" He said his administration would \"re-examine\" all Afghans who came to the U.S. during Joe Biden's presidency.\n\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency later said that it has halted processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely, \"pending further review of security and vetting protocols.\"\n\n\nAccording to the DHS, Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program to resettle thousands of Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the Afghanistan war and feared reprisals from Taliban forces who seized control of their homeland after the U.S. withdrawal.\n\n\nNBC News, citing an interview with an unnamed relative of the suspect, reported early on Thursday that Lakanwal served in the Afghan army for 10 years alongside U.S. Special Forces troops and was stationed in Kandahar for part of that time.\n\n\nThe relative also said Lakanwal was working for online retail giant Amazon.com, the last time they spoke several months ago, according to NBC News.\n\n\nThe DHS did not include other details of his immigration record, but a Trump administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Lakanwal applied for asylum in December 2024 and was approved on April 23 of this year, three months after Trump took office. Lakanwal, 29, who resided in Washington state, had no known criminal history, the official said.\n\n\nThe shooting unfolded at midday outside a subway station in a bustling commercial area within a few blocks of the White House. Secret Service agents placed the presidential mansion under a security lockdown immediately after the shooting as a precaution.\n\n\nIn response to Wednesday's shooting, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the president had asked to send another 500 National Guard troops to join the more than 2,000 Guard soldiers previously mobilized in the nation's capital.\n\nVice President JD Vance, who was in Kentucky on Wednesday, said in a post on X that the shooting proved that the Trump administration's immigration policy was justified.\n\n\n\"We must redouble our efforts to deport people with no right to be in our country,\" he said.\n\n\nCritics of the Trump administration's immigration policy say it has employed illegally harsh tactics and swept up immigrants indiscriminately, including some with no criminal history and others here legally.\n\n\n**ATTACK OUTSIDE SUBWAY STATION**\n\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has clashed openly with Trump over the deployment of Guard troops in her city, told reporters hours after the incident, \"this is a targeted shooting.\"\n\n\nAt the same news briefing, Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, said the two Guard soldiers were \"ambushed\" and that the known assailant appeared to have acted alone.\n\n\nThe two soldiers, members of the West Virginia National Guard, were on a \"high-visibility patrol\" outside the entrance to a subway station when the suspect \"came around the corner,\" drew a weapon and immediately fired at the pair, Carroll said.\n\n\nAfter an exchange of gunfire, other National Guard troops subdued the suspect, he said.\n\n\nTrump said in August he was ordering the National Guard deployment to fight crime in a city he said had become unsafe, despite objections from District of Columbia officials who challenged the move in court as an infringement on local government control.\n\n\nWednesday's shooting came five days after a federal judge issued a ruling to temporarily block National Guard troops from performing law enforcement duties in the district without the mayor's approval, but the judge paused the effect of her order until December to allow an appeal from the Trump administration.\n\n\nTrump, a Republican, has deployed troops in several other Democratic-led cities - Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, Oregon, and Memphis, Tennessee - to combat what he has described as lawlessness and violent unrest over his crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\n\nDemocratic leaders of those cities have accused Trump of manufacturing pretexts for militarized shows of force to punish political foes.",

    "selftext":"Lawmakers will take aim at vehicle-safety mandates in a coming Senate hearing, targeting some auto-industry regulations once considered too sacrosanct to attack. \n\nSenate Republicans in January plan to criticize requirements for safety technology, such as automatic emergency braking and alarms to remind drivers that a child is in the back seat, arguing they are ineffective and will unnecessarily drive up the cost of cars, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nThey aim to head off future requirements touted by safety advocates and argue instead for advancing autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nChief executives of Detroit\u2019s three automakers and a senior Tesla executive have been summoned to appear at a hearing of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation\u2014set for Jan. 14\u2014to explain why vehicles have become so expensive. General Motors and Ford Motor are weighing whether to send their CEOs to the hearing, spokespeople said; Jeep-maker Stellantis declined to comment.\n\nSticker shock is hitting car buyers as the U.S. broadly faces what many consider to be a growing affordability crisis. The average price of a new vehicle hit $50,000 this fall, up from closer to $38,000 before the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, all facets of car ownership\u2014from repairs to loans to insurance\u2014have become costlier.\n\n\u201cAmericans have been clear that they are hyper-focused on affordability,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), who chairs the committee, said in announcing the hearing.\n\n\nVehicle safety advocates argue such mandates save lives and don\u2019t go far enough when some 40,000 people a year die on American roads.\n\n\u201cRegulation is the best way to make sure everybody\u2019s got this technology that\u2019s highly effective,\u201d said a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. \n\nThe hearing comes ahead of next year\u2019s reauthorization of a $300 billion highway bill that provides money for road and rail projects and funding for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \n\nRepublicans on the committee plan to contend that the most effective vehicle-safety advancements\u2014seat belts and steps to improve vehicle crashworthiness\u2014occurred between the 1960s and 1980s, and that benefits have dwindled since, the people said. Safety technology, such as sensors, can be ineffective and costly to repair, they will argue.\n\nThe push comes after the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers succeeded this year in unwinding so-called electric vehicle mandates and other environmental protections that helped usher in the now-sputtering EV movement.\n\nPinning down the factors behind rising car costs is complicated.\n\nRepublicans and major automakers, in advocating the end of some of the most-stringent federal and state clean-air and fuel-economy mandates this year, cited their high costs and that such regulations forced carmakers to shift toward pricier electric vehicles. The January hearing also is expected to address costs associated with clean-air regulations.\n\nAmerican drivers also have shifted to bigger vehicles with more costly creature comforts, such as heated steering wheels and vented seats. The top-selling vehicle in the U.S. is Ford\u2019s F-150 pickup, which can top $70,000. \n\nWhile the Trump administration has spared U.S. automakers much of the brunt of President Trump\u2019s trade war\u2014and the car companies have largely swallowed added costs\u2014analysts say some costs are invariably being passed on to consumers.\n\nAutomakers have long clashed with safety advocates, who are pushing companies to leverage new technology to prevent vehicle deaths.  \n\nNHTSA has rules mandating certain technology, while automakers over the years have agreed to implement safety features voluntarily to pre-empt legislative mandates, such as rear-seat alerts intended to prevent child heatstroke deaths.\n\nOne of the more controversial safety mandates is for auto-braking technology systems, which use sensors, cameras and software to detect potential crashes and automatically apply the brakes. NHTSA last year required automatic braking systems in new cars starting in 2029; automakers have tried to block the rule from taking effect, arguing NHTSA\u2019s standards are impractical and could cause rear-end collisions by braking before drivers expect. The agency said this year that it was considering extending the deadline.\n\nCritics, including the auto industry\u2019s main trade group, argue that specific mandates included in a Biden-era law are impractical and potentially dangerous. Supporters point to data showing the technology could prevent hundreds of deaths a year.",

    "selftext":"Executives are starting to chill out about tariffs after a year of anxiety.\n\nMonths into President Trump\u2019s roller coaster of a global trade war, something has shifted. Business leaders sound less gloomy about tariffs than they have for much of the year. They are talking less about risk when they discuss them with investors. And the subject is no longer dominating earnings calls like before. \n\n\u201cWe believe that the worst of the tariff and economic disruptions to our businesses are now behind us,\u201d said David Maura, chief executive of Spectrum Brands SPB 5.68%increase; green up pointing triangle, which sells everything from pet food to insect repellent, on a call with investors this month. \n\nAnd for good reason. The real tariffs companies pay have turned out to be lower than the headline figures. Companies paid about 12% of the value of their imports as tariffs in October, consulting firm Oxford Economics estimates. That is about 10 percentage points higher than in January, but well below the most dramatic rates announced by the administration over the course of the year.\n\nThe U.S. has meanwhile hammered out new trade agreements, and Supreme Court justices this month questioned Trump\u2019s authority to slap levies on nearly every country on Earth. Companies have also gotten better at mitigating the cost\u2014securing exemptions, raising prices, cutting spending and rearranging supply chains.\n\nThe affordability crunch on voters\u2019 minds could lead to further relief ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections. Trump dropped 40% tariffs on certain agricultural and food products from Brazil this past week. That is on top of the previous week\u2019s rollback of duties on beef, coffee and dozens of other goods in response to Americans\u2019 cost-of-living concerns.\n\n\nCompanies have passed along about two-thirds of tariff costs to consumers so far, excluding food and energy, down from closer to 100% in Trump\u2019s first term, said Bernard Yaros, lead U.S. economist for Oxford Economics.\n\nBig companies especially had healthy profit margins going into the year and have been able to absorb some of the cost.  \n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is the tariffs are manageable for them,\u201d said Parag Thatte, a Deutsche Bank equity analyst.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal analyzed data from more than 5,000 earnings calls held by publicly traded U.S. companies this year through Nov. 14. The analysis considered references by executives to tariffs, plus several related terms, in the same sentence as terms denoting risk. NL Analytics, which provided the data from call transcripts, also categorized executives\u2019 statements referencing tariffs as positive, negative or neutral. \n\nAt Ford Motors, CEO James Farley warned investors in February that tariff proposals at the time \u201cwould have a huge impact on our industry, with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out.\u201d\n\nIn early May, about a month after Trump announced extensive \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, Farley projected that tariffs could cut earnings by a net $1.5 billion in 2025, before interest and taxes. Ford later bumped that estimate up to $2 billion.\n\nA respite came this fall when the U.S. made two changes of significance for automakers. One expanded a program offsetting tariffs on some imported auto parts. That softened Ford\u2019s estimate of how hard tariffs would hit 2025 results\u2014cutting its earlier projection by half to $1 billion. The U.S. also jacked up duties on medium- and heavy-duty trucks.\n\n\nOn a late-October earnings call soon after, Ford executives were less negative, data from NL Analytics show. (Neutral mentions weren\u2019t considered.)\n\nThe heavy-truck tariff doesn\u2019t affect Ford, which doesn\u2019t import heavy trucks, giving it a relative advantage over competitors that do, executives said.\n\n\nHershey entered the second quarter worried about tariffs on cocoa imports and retaliatory duties by Canada, as rising cocoa prices and other factors were also driving up costs. In late October, executives said they could no longer expect a blanket tariff exemption for cocoa imports, and projected a $200 million increase in tariff exposure in 2026. \n\nStill, in the company\u2019s Oct. 30 call, finance chief Steven Voskuil cited \u201cmaybe a little bit more optimism on tariffs\u201d as well as cocoa prices.\n\nThat optimism was borne out: In mid-November, the White House exempted cocoa and dozens of other foods and ingredients from much of the administration\u2019s tariff regime.\n\n\u201cCocoa was more than half of our total exposure, so the tariff impact has improved for \u201926,\u201d a Hershey spokeswoman said. \n\nOther companies are less sanguine.\n\nMasterBrand, billed as North America\u2019s biggest residential cabinet maker, was cautious but not pessimistic in May. \u201cI don\u2019t think the tariffs are having a massive amount of impact particular to our business,\u201d CEO David Banyard told investors then. \u201cWe\u2019re insulated a bit more than other industries.\u201d\n\nOne uncertainty executives flagged: potentially significant costs if the administration imposed tariffs on wood-product imports or other materials. Among other factors, MasterBrand imports nearly all of its bathroom vanities from Mexico.\n\nTrump in late September announced new tariffs rising to 50% on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and similar products. Tariffs knocked nearly a percentage point off MasterBrand\u2019s gross margin in the third quarter. In October, previously announced duties on imported lumber and wood products kicked in, and MasterBrand said the impact could be as much as 8% of annual net sales before mitigation.\n\nUltimately, the company expects to offset its ongoing tariff costs, including by raising prices and renegotiating with suppliers. But that takes time, Banyard told investors. \u201cThat is the hardest part of this tariff regime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt comes in fairly quickly, and it takes us time to mitigate it.\u201d",

    "selftext":"**Excavating the Builder\u2019s Remedy**\n\nAbout a decade ago, the California Legislature started revving up its housing efforts again by sharpening the existing laws\u2019 teeth. Among those changes were two tweaks that would prove pivotal: Urban areas would now have to plan for much more housing than they had in the past, and it became easier for developers to sue cities that deny their projects.\n\nThose efforts got an unexpected boost on New Year\u2019s Day 2019. That afternoon, Christopher Elmendorf, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, whose social media account is followed closely by developers and their lawyers, published a thread on Twitter. In it, he detailed a little-noticed clause that, in certain instances, could nullify a city\u2019s zoning completely.\n\n\u201cCA housing folks: Why haven\u2019t builders exploited the state law exempting 20%-affordable projects from zoning \/ plan in cities that don\u2019t accommodate enough?\u201d it began.\n\nWhat he had suggested was the land use equivalent of plutonium.\n\nOver more than a dozen tweets, Mr. Elmendorf argued that since 1990, California had had a loophole that allowed developers to bypass the local zoning codes in cities whose housing element was deemed noncompliant by the state. In a follow-up paper, he called it the \u201cbuilder\u2019s remedy,\u201d a nod to a similar mechanism that arose from New Jersey court rulings that have shaped housing policy in that state.\n\nThe clause had rarely been used. But, as it happened, the conditions for exploiting it were historically perfect. Cities across the state were about to be hit with increases in housing target numbers so steep that regulators were all but guaranteed to deem their plans noncompliant.\n\nFew cities saw a bigger impact than Beverly Hills: The city\u2019s previous housing element required it to plan for three (yes, three) new housing units. Under the new allocation that would take effect in 2023, it had to plan for more than 3,000.\n\nBeverly Hills did file a plan for more than 3,000 units, but placed most of them in high-traffic areas occupied by retail and office buildings, including the headquarters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Was a developer really going to turn the academy\u2019s building into apartments and condos?\n\nAn advocacy group called Californians for Homeownership sued the city, arguing that much of the new housing that Beverly Hills had planned for would never be built. A judge agreed, and the city\u2019s housing element was ruled out of compliance with state regulations.\n\nEven so, many builders were reluctant to bring builder\u2019s remedy cases, worried that those projects would alienate cities that they would likely have to work with in the future.\n\n\u201cJust like any other industry, sometimes you need a few pirates to change the dynamic,\u201d said Dave Rand, a partner at Rand Paster &amp; Nelson in Los Angeles, a land-use firm that represents Leo Pustilnikov.\n\nMr. Pustilnikov was willing to be that pirate.\n\n**Remaking Cities (and Suburbs)**\n\nOn a recent afternoon I met Mr. Pustilnikov at a white-tablecloth Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills about a mile from his Linden Drive lot. Mr. Rand, his lawyer, had told me to look for the worst-dressed guy in the room. Sure enough, there I found Mr. Pustilnikov waiting for me in shorts, flip-flops and a T-shirt whose collar appeared to have just come out of a tug of war.\n\nMunching bread while waiters wearing ties moved from table to table, Mr. Pustilnikov explained that his specialty were deals with \u201chair,\u201d by which he means complicated transactions with a lot of risk. Until recently, his public profile came mostly from being the owner of several aging buildings in downtown Los Angeles that are set aside for low-income tenants, many of them exiting homelessness.\n\nAs for the builder\u2019s remedy projects he had proposed in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, West Hollywood and Redondo Beach, he told me that in most cases he didn\u2019t plan to build them himself. Rather, his hope is to get the buildings entitled and sell the land to another builder for a premium. This would allow him to profit from engaging in the sort of pitched battle \u2014 in other words, hair \u2014 that a more conflict-averse developer might be reluctant to tackle.\n\nBeverly Hills was a particularly enticing target. On paper it is an independent municipality of 32,000 people with its own school district and police department where boundaries are marked by the city\u2019s iconic, shield-shaped signs. But it is surrounded by Los Angeles.\n\nWhen Mr. Pustilnikov began pursuing the Linden tower, builder\u2019s remedy projects had to set aside 20 percent of their units for below-market-rate tenants. (The percentage has since been lowered by new state legislation.) Paradoxically, building affordable units is more feasible in affluent areas like Beverly Hills because developers can charge much higher rents on the market-rate units.\n\nBeverly Hills has since seen 16 applications for builder\u2019s remedy developments. Residents are appalled. In letters opposing Linden Drive, neighbors said the project would destroy the neighborhood by encouraging other developers to \u201cbuild huge\u201d and made it feel as if \u201cthe walls are caving in, and we have no word.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of us are opposed to affordable housing,\u201d said Kenneth Goldman, president of the Southwest Beverly Hills Homeowners Association. But a building that was almost four times the city\u2019s height limit?\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a NIMBY to say that\u2019s just so far out of line,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter Mr. Pustilnikov submitted the Linden Drive project, the City Council unanimously rejected his proposal.\n\nThe city was sued \u2014 twice, first by Californians for Homeownership and then by Mr. Pustilnikov. The suits were joined, and in August, Judge Curtis A. Kin \u2014 who, because this is Southern California, was once a contestant on the reality-TV show \u201cBig Brother\u201d \u2014 ruled for Mr. Pustilnikov. Beverly Hills still has a month to appeal the decision, but it would be expensive. To discourage cities from dragging out development fights in court, state law mandates that cities appealing their losses for this type of case post a bond that can easily eclipse $10 million.\n\nThe Linden Drive litigation is likely to be a bellwether, Mr. Rand said, prompting other cities to approve builder\u2019s remedy projects outright or at least quickly cut deals with developers.\n\nIn the months since Mr. Pustilnikov\u2019s court victory, the Beverly Hills Planning Commission has voted to approve nine builder\u2019s remedy projects, totaling 659 units. That would be more housing than Beverly Hills had built in recent memory.\n\n**How to Create a Credible Threat**\n\nIf California is ever going to dent its housing problem, it will have to figure out how to make it easier to add more housing in urban cores. Sprawl remains the cheapest and most effective way to add a lot of housing in a hurry, and there\u2019s almost no way the nation can solve its housing shortage without building a lot more of it.\n\nBut in California and around the country, the highest rents and worst cost burdens are almost always in the job-rich areas that are already developed. Figuring out how to build housing in neighborhoods where building is expensive and difficult, and large blocs of voters reject it, is a puzzle that no U.S. city has fully solved.\n\nEdward Glaeser, a Harvard economist, and Joseph Gyourko, a finance professor at the Wharton School, noted in a recent paper that many of the fast-growing Sun Belt cities \u2014 the ones to which people priced out of California tend to relocate \u2014 had seen a sharp run-up in housing costs. The reason, the authors concluded, is that their residents are no more enthusiastic about adding density in single-family neighborhoods than are the people of Berkeley or Beverly Hills.\n\nTo once again become the nation\u2019s housing pioneer, California will have to develop the political will to reform its urban areas and old suburbs into something denser and easier to navigate without a car. The lesson of the builder\u2019s remedy is that, so far, the most effective way of doing this is to create a credible threat that housing-averse cities can\u2019t ignore.\n\nLast year, the Legislature passed a bill, introduced by Ms. Wicks, that explicitly codified the builder\u2019s remedy in a modified form: Developers could more easily avail themselves of the tactic in exchange for set limits on density. They cannot build anything they want, but the allowable densities are still several times as large as what local zoning rules allow.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the builder\u2019s remedy is likely to be measured not just in units that are built by using it, but in the ones built in fear of it. A few years ago, when Santa Monica was working on its housing element, Jesse Zwick, who was running to be a member of the City Council, sat in frustration while his future colleagues voted for a plan that the state ultimately rejected for failing to provide enough units, he said.\n\nThen developers, including Mr. Pustilnikov, came along, and the wealthy beachfront city was blanketed with housing proposals. The city ended up settling with builders, and the effect is likely to be felt long after.\n\n\u201cThe fear of builder\u2019s remedy brought along a lot of people whose inclination was to fight everything,\u201d Mr. Zwick said. \u201cThey realized it was in our interest to grow and at least be able to have a say in how we do that.\u201d",

    "selftext":"This is a gift article, no paywall. Text below just in case. \n\nOne way or the other, the answer was going to be yes.\n\nWhen Leo Pustilnikov filed an application in 2023 with the City of Beverly Hills to build a 19-story apartment tower with a hotel, the developer didn\u2019t care that it flouted the zoning code or that the City Council was unanimously opposed to the project or that neighbors had described it as a \u201cmonstrosity.\u201d He had the city backed into a corner and wasn\u2019t going to pretend otherwise.\n\n\u201cMy philosophy is always this: If I can work with a city, I\u2019m more than happy to,\u201d Mr. Pustilnikov said. \u201cWhen a city doesn\u2019t want to help, I have no problem ignoring them and doing it my way.\u201d\n\nThis was not the way business was normally done in Beverly Hills, a famously wealthy enclave where development is tightly controlled. It\u2019s a tough place to build. Land is expensive, labor is expensive and NIMBYism \u2014 the not-in-my-backyard sentiment that exists everywhere \u2014 is particularly strong. The city\u2019s zoning rules discourage projects that are tall and bulky and that might anger the owners of single-family houses nearby. Five stories is the tallest allowable height for a multifamily residential building \u2014 and those are permitted on only a few blocks of the city.\n\nMr. Pustilnikov was determined to change that. After two decades of investing in low-income apartments in downtown Los Angeles, he had stumbled upon a little-known state law that allowed him to ram high-density projects like the 19-story tower on South Linden Drive into cities that didn\u2019t want them.\n\nThe law is called the \u201cbuilder\u2019s remedy,\u201d and it was designed to break the political logjams that have made California one of the most difficult places in the country to build. The law works by nullifying local zoning rules when cities fail to plan for enough housing as required by the state.\n\nWhile the builder\u2019s remedy has been on the books since 1990, it was effectively dormant until 2022. Since then, however, developers across the state have filed dozens of plans to build 10- and 20-story buildings in neighborhoods where they had never been allowed. Mr. Pustilnikov, who helped pioneer the tactic, has proposed 10 such projects across Los Angeles County.\n\nBrian Hanlon, chief executive of California YIMBY, a group that pushes for more housing, referred to the builder\u2019s remedy as \u201cthe NIMBY sword of Damocles.\u201d Just the threat of it has prompted cities to accept more housing than they had in decades.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s housing crisis is well documented and severe. But it\u2019s not unique. From New York to Los Angeles, and countless smaller places in between, a festering housing shortage has forced Americans to spend more of their budgets on shelter, making them feel poorer and stuck in place.\n\nThere is wide agreement that America hasn\u2019t been able to build enough housing; the need to do something about the shortage is one of the few things Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on. Despite this, the gap between the abstract agreement that we need more housing and the construction of a specific project on a specific block makes it difficult to build what the country requires.\n\nInterest groups are reluctant to curb regulations, such as environmental rules, that can add years even to small projects. And the desire to keep a neighborhood from changing is deeply ingrained in local politics and the human psyche. There are just too many things to object to: Traffic. Not enough parking. Complaints that the building is poorly designed or blots out sunlight, or should be a park instead.\n\nTo address this, Sacramento legislators have spent the past decade writing a slew of laws that aim to create more housing. The laws vary from tiny coding changes that ease the way for backyard \u201cgranny flats\u201d to a tectonic rewrite of the state\u2019s landmark environmental law. The net effect is to nudge neighborhoods to become taller and denser by eroding local control over land use. Other states, including Oregon, Massachusetts, Montana, Texas and Arizona, have used similar tactics to increase the housing supply.\n\nBuffy Wicks, a Democrat in the State Assembly from Oakland who has written several laws to speed housing production, argues that the state has to slice through both local rules and the bureaucracy that the state itself produced.\n\n\u201cWe have gotten in our own way and created a quagmire that makes it impossible to build the housing we need,\u201d she said.\n\nThe builder\u2019s remedy has the potential to supercharge this, though it\u2019s still too early to say how effective it will ultimately be. So far, developers seem to have the upper hand: When cities have challenged the cases, builders have often won. In response, cities have started reluctantly approving taller buildings that used to be unthinkable. In August, Mr. Pustilnikov prevailed in a case against Beverly Hills over the Linden Drive project.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the state has seen fit to take a good deal of local zoning out of the hands of cities,\u201d said Larry Wiener, the city attorney for Beverly Hills, in a statement.\n\nThe irony is that the builder\u2019s remedy was rediscovered almost by accident. Even Ms. Wicks, one of California\u2019s most staunchly pro-housing lawmakers, said the Legislature would never be able to pass the law now because of opposition from local governments. Thus, one of California\u2019s most effective laws for building housing was not a product of its housing emergency or political will, but a legislative relic.\n\n\u201cThe politics to pass anything resembling builder\u2019s remedy would be way too difficult today,\u201d Ms. Wicks said. \u201cSo one of the most powerful tools in combating our housing crisis is a law that passed\u201d three decades ago.\n\nMr. Pustilnikov wasted no time trying to teach the city a lesson. After the judge ruled in his favor, he threatened to amend the Linden Drive building to make it even taller.\n\n**Building Where People Live**\n\nA truism of development is that it is harder to build things where people live than where they don\u2019t. In the decades after World War II, California grew to become the most populous state not by constructing tall buildings but by spreading subdivisions over farms and orchards and connecting them with thousands of miles of freeways. Sun Belt cities like Dallas and Phoenix copied that playbook.\n\nThe backlash to sprawl came in the 1960s and \u201970s, with local growth moratoriums and fights against freeways. As an alternative, environmentalists suggested building more densely in existing cities, what became known as smart growth.\n\nBut as much as people might lament paving over a cow pasture, nothing seems to rile them up as much as new construction in their own neighborhood. Over the past 30 years, California\u2019s Legislature has been trying to counteract this hyperlocal opposition. The process has been a zigzagging slog. But the overall trend shows the state trying to wrest power from local governments. The laws the state created play out mostly out of public view through a web of arcane planning processes, the end result of which is a document called a \u201chousing element.\u201d\n\nA housing element is basically a planning report that cities have to file with the state every eight years. In it, they detail, over hundreds of pages of maps and dense bureaucratese, how they plan to permit a certain amount of housing at various levels of affordability, a number that is decided by state and regional governments.\n\nThe problem is that the process has historically been a charade. Cities often produced housing elements that positioned future housing in inaccessible areas, and while developers and the state could challenge the plans, usually neither did. Since local officials were beholden to voters who rarely wanted new development, little was built.",

    "selftext":"U.S. job growth defied expectations in September, according to a Labor Department report issued nearly seven weeks late due to the government shutdown.\nPayrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 119,000 on the month, the strongest gain since April, the Labor Department said Thursday.\n\nThat was well above the gain of 50,000 jobs economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected to see.\n\nHowever August\u2019s payrolls number was revised to a loss of 4,000 jobs, and July\u2019s payrolls were revised slightly lower to a 72,000 gain. That meant employment in July and August combined was 33,000 lower than previously reported.\n\nThe unemployment rate, which is based on a separate survey from the jobs figures, rose slightly to 4.4% as nearly half a million people joined the labor force. Economists expected the unemployment rate to hold at 4.3%.\n\n\nThough greatly delayed\u2014these numbers were initially scheduled for release on Oct. 3\u2014the September report offered the first official look since before the shutdown on the state of a critical economic marker for investors and policymakers. The Federal Reserve, for instance, uses the job report to help it make decisions about interest rates.\n\nThe longest shutdown on record began Oct. 1. Before ending last week, it put a halt to nearly all the government economic data releases that Wall Street and policymakers rely on to measure the economy\u2019s health.\n\nThe government won\u2019t be able to completely fill in the blanks. The Labor Department said Wednesday it won\u2019t release an unemployment rate for October because it couldn\u2019t collect the necessary data. It will release data from a separate survey on the number of jobs created or lost in October with the November payrolls report, which the agency scheduled for release on Dec. 16.\n\nThat means the Federal Reserve will be heading into its next policy gathering on Dec. 9-10 with a stale picture of the job market in recent months. The Labor Department hasn\u2019t said whether it will produce a consumer-price index report for October, but the White House has said it is unlikely.\n\nMinutes of the Fed\u2019s October gathering showed deepening divisions over whether the central bank should cut interest rates next month.\n\u201cParticipants expressed strongly differing views about what policy decision would most likely be appropriate at the committee\u2019s December meeting,\u201d according to a written record of the meeting released Wednesday afternoon with the customary three-week lag. The minutes noted that \u201cavailable indicators were consistent with a continued gradual cooling in the labor market without any evidence of a sharp deterioration.\u201d\n\nWhile the federal data are incomplete, there are other signs that the labor market remains unsettled. Major companies including Amazon.com and Target recently announced they were cutting thousands of corporate jobs.\n\nMeantime, consumer sentiment dropped in early November on concerns about the shutdown\u2019s negative economic impact, according to a survey by the University of Michigan. More than 70% of households said they expect unemployment to increase over the next year.\n\n\n\nA survey from the National Federation of Independent Business found small-business optimism also declined slightly in October. Owners reported lower sales and reduced profits, NFIB said, and many firms said they were having difficulty finding labor.\n\n\nDespite the dearth of government data in recent weeks, estimates for economic growth in the third quarter point to a strong showing. The Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model forecasts annualized economic growth of 4.2% for the July to September period.\n\n\nThe third quarter was largely strong for company earnings\u2014Nvidia\u00a0reported record sales and strong guidance Wednesday, helping soothe jitters about an artificial-intelligence bubble. But some companies cautioned that consumers are increasingly bifurcated, with high income households spending strongly while younger and lower-income consumers are under strain.\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Home Depot reported lower third-quarter profit and trimmed its full-year outlook, as economic uncertainty, high interest rates and a stagnant housing market prompted homeowners to scale back home improvements.\n\n\n\u201cOur customers tell us that they remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty and perhaps the hesitation to make larger financial commitments amid an uncertain economic environment,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said Tuesday.\n\n\nTarget on Wednesday trimmed its profit guidance for this year, saying fewer shoppers visited its stores in the third quarter and those who did spent less. The quarter was volatile because of several external factors, such as the pause in federal food-assistance benefits funding and the government shutdown, according to incoming Chief Executive Michael Fiddelke.",

The companies said the partnership will allow Intuit to leverage OpenAI frontier models for cutting-edge use cases across the business. The contract also includes Intuit\u2019s continued use of ChatGPT Enterprise across the company. It helps Intuit employees incorporate AI into daily workflows and further improve productivity, the companies said.\n\n&gt; The combination of ChatGPT\u2019s accessibility and Intuit\u2019s expertise is \u201ca way to unlock financial literacy\u2026at a scale that hasn\u2019t been tried before,\u201d said Simo.

I think that\u2019s not overblown.\u201d However, he cautioned that the pace at which consumers and businesses fully integrate AI into every part of their lives is \u201ca bit overblown,\u201d because difficult tasks such as those involving money and finance require high trust and accuracy.",

    "selftext":"Could there be a better example of Congressional dysfunction than that its first pressing business after the government reopens is . . . the return of the Jeffrey Epstein follies? This is exactly what the American people weren\u2019t waiting for.\n\nBut this is Washington in 2025, so everyone is obsessing about Epstein\u2019s emails from the grave that mention Donald Trump long before he was President. Democrats selectively leaked the emails (acquired as part of a Congressional investigation) that refer to Mr. Trump. Republicans countered by releasing thousands of other emails that are embarrassing for many but tell us little new about the deceased sexual offender.\n\nEveryone knew Mr. Trump and Epstein palled around in New York in the 1990s and early 2000s, though they later had a falling out. This was clear in the 2024 election and it had become an issue in Mr. Trump\u2019s first term when Democrats assailed a plea bargain struck by Labor Secretary Alex Acosta when he had been a prosecutor in Florida. Mr. Acosta resigned\u2014needlessly, we said at the time, because the plea deal at least guaranteed a felony conviction and Epstein served 13 months in jail.\n\nThe new Epstein email getting the most attention is from 2011 addressed to his fellow trafficker in young women, Ghislaine Maxwell: \u201ci want you to realize that that dog that hasn\u2019t barked is trump. . . [Victim\u2019s name redacted] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75% there.\u201d \n\nThe email\u2019s context isn\u2019t clear, nor do we know what being \u201c75% there\u201d means. The victim in question, the tragic Virginia Giuffre, said publicly before she committed suicide that Mr. Trump never participated in anything nefarious. She certainly wasn\u2019t reticent about other men in the Epstein circle.\n\nDemocrats, and a few Republicans, are demanding again that the Justice Department release all of its Epstein files for the sake of \u201ctransparency.\u201d There appear to be enough votes in the House to pass a discharge petition commanding the release of those files, with a possible vote next week. \n\nThe complication for the transparency crowd is that the Biden Justice Department had all of these documents for four years and could have released them. They also could have used them to prosecute others besides Ms. Maxwell (now in prison) and Epstein if they thought they could get a conviction. Biden officials certainly weren\u2019t shy about attacking or even indicting Mr. Trump.\n\nAs is so often the case, Mr. Trump has been his own worst enemy here. As a candidate he fanned the expectations of the Epstein conspiracy theorists who think government is protecting the rich and powerful. Once in power, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel teased explosive findings but later said there\u2019s nothing to see.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump has resorted to his usual default that it\u2019s all a \u201choax,\u201d even as he strong-arms Republicans to oppose the discharge petition. He looks like he has something to hide even if he doesn\u2019t.\n\nWhat Ms. Bondi should have done long ago is call a press conference, explain why she doesn\u2019t want to release more files than she already has, and take the media heat. There are good reasons of privacy and unfair guilt by association not to dump hundreds of thousands of pages of raw FBI investigatory files into the public arena. Some victims who so far may not have been publicly identified could also be hurt. \n\n\n\nDemocrats want to keep the Epstein story going because it embarrasses Mr. Trump, and maybe the files will cough up something worse. Republicans don\u2019t want to get cross-wise with that part of the MAGA base that thinks everything is a deep-state conspiracy. This is what passes these days for doing the people\u2019s business in Washington.",

    "selftext":"**Article:** \n\nThe turning point in the government\u2019s longest shutdown didn\u2019t involve President Trump or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nInstead, after the Senate adjourned for the day and most reporters had emptied out of the halls, a small group of breakaway Democrats and an independent slipped unnoticed into the office of Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R., S.D.).\n\nThe shutdown was nearing the one-month mark and the group was growing antsy as federal workers missed paychecks and food-aid programs ran out of money. Two nights before Halloween, the senators sat down with Thune, ready to reopen the government, people familiar with the meeting said. \u201cIt was a group of people trying to solve a problem,\u201d said Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and helped lead negotiations. \n\nThe meeting\u2014one of several\u2014had been requested by King and other centrists, including New Hampshire\u2019s Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, all former governors. Republicans in attendance were Thune and Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota, also a former governor and senior member of the powerful appropriations committee.\n\nThe group told Schumer they were talking to Thune and read him into their discussions, but Schumer didn\u2019t participate directly, according to senators involved. Schumer wanted to extend the shutdown, arguing Trump would eventually engage in talks himself and they would get a better deal\u2014one that would address expiring Obamacare health-insurance subsidies that Democrats had made their central demand in the shutdown fight, people familiar with Schumer\u2019s position said.\n\nThe talks between the centrists and Republicans ultimately produced an agreement that would end the standoff but divide Democrats, with some seeing it as a failure of Schumer\u2019s gamble that he could hold his caucus together long enough to force Trump to the negotiating table.\n\nThroughout the shutdown, Schumer, the Senate\u2019s most powerful Democrat, was on the sidelines, allowing a small subset of his conference to engage with Senate Republicans. The deal they reached funded much of the government through Jan. 30 and some programs, such as food aid, for a full year. It has enraged many progressives and party activists, who say that the group got virtually nothing in return, and many have directed their anger at Schumer even though he didn\u2019t vote for it. Schumer\u2019s critics say his inability to keep his party united is an indictment of his leadership.\n\nThose Democrats\u2019 biggest gripe is that they are walking away with no guarantees that expiring health-insurance subsidies will be extended. In the negotiations with Thune, the group of centrist Democrats were willing to forgo such a guarantee: Thune offered them a vote on the subsidies by mid-December, though he wouldn\u2019t promise an outcome.\n\nShaheen said that meeting face to face with Thune helped convince her that he would keep his word. \n\n\u201cWe sat across from him, we looked him eye to eye,\u201d Shaheen said. She also has a backstop, since much of the funding expires at the end of January, when Democrats could trigger a shutdown again. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly an option that I think everybody will consider,\u201d Shaheen said.\n\n\n**Divided Democrats**\n\nKing, Shaheen, Hassan and other centrist Democrats updated Schumer regularly on their discussions with Thune and Republican appropriators, lawmakers said. In addition to Hoeven, they were working with Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the appropriations chair, and Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama.\n\nThey believed that Schumer would carry more Democrats with him if he voted yes. Schumer told the group that he was open to a deal, as he had said publicly, but he thought what they had come up with wasn\u2019t strong enough and suggested changes, a senator and aides familiar with the conversations said. He also asked them to wait on committing to anything until after Nov. 1, the start of Obamacare open enrollment, and then until after Election Day on Tuesday, Nov. 4., which they agreed to do.\n\nFrustrated Republicans publicly accused Schumer of holding their Democratic partners back. King said Schumer was providing feedback. \u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to end-run him, and he had some input into what we were working on,\u201d King said.\n\nOn Election Day, Shaheen presented the centrists\u2019 plan to their caucus at a lunchtime meeting, hours before polls closed in Virginia, New Jersey and other states, people familiar with the lunch said. More than a dozen Democrats were interested in the deal but not yet ready to vote for it.\n\n\nMost of the caucus still wanted to stick together, especially once the full extent of their party\u2019s landslide election victories became clear Wednesday morning.\n\nBut the shutdown was hitting new pain points. Flight delays piled up starting Friday. Some constituents had lost several paychecks. Others had lost federal food-assistance benefits or subsidies to heat their homes.\n\nBy Sunday, eight Democrats were no longer willing to wait.\n\n**The strategy \u2018wasn\u2019t working\u2019**\n\nSchumer\u2019s allies say he did the best he could with a bad hand and pointed out that few Republicans had expected Senate Democrats to hold out as long as they did.\n\nBut King said it had become apparent to him and others involved in talks with Republicans over the past few weeks that Trump wasn\u2019t going to engage.\n\n\u201cWe were harming a lot of people in the service of a strategy that wasn\u2019t working. That\u2019s it in a nutshell,\u201d King said. \n\nInstead of negotiating, the White House nixed plans for stand-alone votes that would have paid air-traffic controllers or funded food stamps, rejected meeting requests from Democrats and refused to negotiate on healthcare until the government reopened.\n\nSchumer made what would be his final offer on Friday: Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to extend expiring subsidies for a year. Republicans immediately rejected the move and the centrists\u2019 deal gained momentum over the weekend. \n\nOn Sunday, Schumer said he couldn\u2019t vote for a deal \u201cthat fails to address the healthcare crisis.\u201d With limited Democratic support, Republicans needed Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.) to be the critical eighth vote. Britt said she worked with Kaine, the White House and GOP leadership to add language reversing federal layoffs initiated during the shutdown\u2014and banning future layoffs through the end of January.\n\nWith Kaine now a yes, the Senate overcame a key procedural hurdle in a 60-40 vote late Sunday, advancing the measure to reopen the government with not a single vote to spare.\n\nSchumer, who had drawn scorn in March for voting with Republicans to avert a shutdown, now drew scorn for failing to keep a shutdown going. He has claimed a partial victory in making healthcare costs the centerpiece of Democrats\u2019 fight heading into midterm elections.\n\nIn a speech on Monday, Schumer warned that Trump and other Republicans will come to regret not negotiating to fix the subsidies when they had the chance.\n\n\u201cRepublicans now own this healthcare crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThey knew it was coming. We wanted to fix it. Republicans said no.\u201d",

    "selftext":"**Article:** \n\nPresident Trump pressured Democrats by taking punishing actions no previous administration ever took during a shutdown.\n\nThe government shutdown is already the longest in American history. But it\u2019s also perhaps the most punishing, in part because President Trump has taken actions no previous administration ever took during a shutdown.\n\nOver the past six weeks, the Trump administration cut food stamps for millions of low-income Americans. It tried to fire thousands of government workers and withhold back pay from others, while freezing or canceling money for projects in Democratic-led states.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether there will be a political price to pay for Mr. Trump or his party, with polls showing that voters generally blamed Republicans more for the shutdown. But for now, the tactics appear to have worked, after a group of Democrats agreed to support a bill to end the shutdown and drop the concessions their party had demanded.\n\n\u201cStanding up to Donald Trump didn\u2019t work,\u201d Senator Angus King, independent of Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, said on MSNBC Monday. \u201cIt actually gave him more power.\u201d\n\nThe bare-knuckle politics the Trump administration employed during the shutdown \u2014 often coming from his budget director Russell T. Vought, whom Mr. Trump refers to as Darth Vader \u2014 became too brutal for the handful of centrist Senate Democrats, who never liked the idea of the shutdown much anyway.\n\nThe deal they voted for on Monday reverses much of the pain Mr. Trump inflicted. Under its terms, the president must rescind his layoffs and restore back pay to other government workers. Democrats will also get a vote on extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, something that Senate Republicans weeks ago offered them.\n\nWhile the shutdown may be ending, Democratic officials say the party learned a lesson that base voters reward them when they fight. Democratic leaders view last week\u2019s elections, with big victories in governor\u2019s races in New Jersey and Virginia, as evidence that their strategy was working. They point to polling that indicates that the public was blaming Mr. Trump and Republicans more than Democrats for the shutdown.\n\n\u201cRepublicans all across the country got wiped out,\u201d said Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the top Democrat in the House, adding, \u201cAs House Democrats, we know we\u2019re on the right side of this fight.\u201d\n\nDemocrats also believe they now have an issue to run on in the midterm elections. They have highlighted issues important to voters, positioning themselves in the public\u2019s mind as the party fighting for lowering health care costs, while they can contrast those efforts with the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to deny food stamps to needy families.\n\nBut Trump officials have also learned a lesson.\n\nIf they wait out Democrats long enough \u2014 and turn up the pain enough \u2014 they will back down.\n\nEarly in the shutdown, White House officials had predicted Democrats would eventually fold. They saw little need for Mr. Trump to negotiate with the Democratic leaders, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Mr. Jeffries.\n\nThe strategy, White House officials said, was to wait out the Democrats, ramp up the pain and then watch as they eventually caved.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said he approves of the deal under consideration to reopen the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be opening up our country very quickly,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Asked if that meant he would back off his attempts to fire federal workers, he said: \u201cI\u2019ll abide by the deal. The deal is very good.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also made it clear that he wants to position the Republicans as the party that is working for lower health care costs. He said he wants to move toward a health care system that cuts out insurance companies.\n\n\u201cWe want a health care system where we pay the money to the people instead of the insurance companies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I tell you, we\u2019re going to be working on that very hard over the next short period of time.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Trump offered no details about what such a plan could look like or how it could save money for consumers.\n\nThere may still be more fallout from the shutdown even after it is resolved.\n\nSome House Democrats, dissatisfied that Mr. Schumer couldn\u2019t better control his caucus and hold the line on Democratic demands, called for him to be replaced.\n\n\u201cSenator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,\u201d Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, said in a post on X. \u201cIf you can\u2019t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Jeffries said he was standing by his counterpart in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, have waged a valiant fight over the last seven weeks,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said.",

Republican National Committee, asks the justices to determine the meaning of \u201cElection Day.\u201d It is a potential blockbuster and adds to the court\u2019s other elections and voting cases for the term, which include a case about who can sue to challenge Illinois\u2019 mail-in ballot rules and a challenge to the Louisiana congressional district map that could gut a remaining pillar of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe Republican National Committee challenged Mississippi\u2019s mail-in ballot rules, arguing that Congress had intended that voting take place on a single Election Day and that allowing ballots to arrive days later and still be counted undermined election integrity and the public\u2019s trust in the vote.\n\nMississippi argued that Congress only set a date by when voters must make their choice, not the date by when ballots must arrive. Mississippi defended its grace period, which is similar to ones in place in many other states, as allowing elections officials to count ballots that have been mailed by Election Day but arrive a few days after.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, generally viewed as one of the nation\u2019s most conservative appeals courts, sided with the R.N.C.

    "selftext":"**Article:** \n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday rejected a long-shot bid to overturn the landmark 2015 decision that gave same-sex couples the constitutional right to marry. \n\nThe court, in a brief written order, turned away an appeal by Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk who was sued by a gay couple whom she denied a marriage license 10 days after the Supreme Court issued its ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges.  \n\nShe turned to the Supreme Court after an appeals court refused to grant her immunity from having to pay the $100,000 a jury awarded the couple for the emotional distress they suffered in having their right to marry denied.\n\nThe court\u2019s Obergefell decision was among its most consequential in decades. The 5-4 ruling, written by since-retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, said the right to marry is a fundamental liberty that is protected equally for everyone, including same-sex couples, under the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection.\n\nThe Supreme Court has grown more conservative in the years since. The court\u2019s 2022 decision overruling Roe v. Wade and eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion raised new questions about what other precedents the court might be interested in revisiting. Justice Clarence Thomas has explicitly called for the court to revisit the marriage ruling.\n\nIn her petition to the Supreme Court, Davis argued that Obergefell created a new constitutional right out of whole cloth that had ruinous consequences for religious liberty.\n\nWhile some LGBTQ advocates feared the court might take the case, Davis\u2019s petition had procedural complications that would have made it difficult for the justices to consider it. The gay couple on the other side of the litigation argued that Davis had waived her ability to seek reconsideration of Obergefell because she didn\u2019t make that argument at earlier stages of the litigation.",

    "selftext":"The list from the article \n\n**Democrats\u2019 unity crumbled as the shutdown dragged on.**\n-\n\nFor 40 days, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, kept his Democratic caucus unified as a government shutdown stretched into record-breaking territory.\n\nBut that discipline couldn\u2019t hold forever, and it broke without Democrats achieving what they insisted was their chief demand in the fight: the extension of health insurance subsidies that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year.\n\nThe group of moderate senators who broke from their party said they could no longer hold out on a deal while Americans suffered the consequences of a shuttered government. And they cited a commitment from Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Republican leader, that they would at least receive a vote on the tax credits sometime in December.\n\n\u201cThis bill is not perfect, but it takes important steps to reduce their shutdown\u2019s hurt,\u201d Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, said in a statement explaining why he backed the deal.\n\nStill, the promise of a vote does not guarantee that legislation will be passed. In fact, any measure to address health care subsidies faces long odds in a Republican-controlled Congress and given President Trump\u2019s frequent broadsides against the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs a result, the deal put bitter Democratic divisions on display. Mr. Schumer tersely told reporters that he would not vote for the bill because it lacked health care provisions, and he voiced objections on the Senate floor.\n\nHouse Democrats, including the minority leader, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, blasted the deal as insufficient.\n\n\u201cHouse Democrats have consistently maintained that bipartisan legislation that funds the government must also decisively address the Republican health care crisis,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nRepresentative Ro Khanna of California went a step further, saying that Mr. Schumer \u201cis no longer effective and should be replaced.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?\u201d he said in a social media post.\n\n**Health care will stay in the political spotlight.**\n-\n\nSince Republicans passed a domestic policy package earlier this year that included steep Medicaid cuts, Democrats have focused their attacks against Republicans on the issue of health care, particularly as they eye the midterm elections next year.\n\nTheir bid to win health care concessions in the shutdown deal failed. Health care premiums, at least for now, are on track to rise, at a time when Americans say they are worried about paying for medical care.\n\nBut the political silver lining for Democrats is that Republicans will now be under pressure to either embrace a measure that could bring down those costs or answer to voters who polls show are overwhelmingly in favor of doing so.\n\nIf the agreement holds and the shutdown ends, the spotlight will shift to the vote Mr. Thune has promised on whether to extend the health care tax credits, and Democrats made clear that they intend to continue to pressure Republicans on the issue.\n\n\n\u201cWe are going to fight legislatively, fight back home, fight in the courts, and bring this fight in the elections,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor. \u201cHealth care costs made a major impact on the 2025 election, and they will certainly have an even greater impact on the 2026 election.\u201d\n\nOne indicator that Democrats expect the health care fight to define the political debate to come: Every Democratic senator who is running for re-election next year opposed the shutdown deal.\n\nThe eight who backed it included senators who could afford to take a political hit, including two who are retiring, Mr. Durbin and Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. Three others \u2014 Senators John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire \u2014 are not up for re-election until 2028. And the remaining three don\u2019t face voters again until 2030: Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia, Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Mr. King.\n\n\n**Trump\u2019s pressure tactics worked, even as voters blamed his party.**\n-\n\nMr. Thune had been offering for weeks to give Democrats a vote on extending the health care subsidies. They only relented after the Trump administration had made the consequences of the shutdown too painful to ignore.\n\nAsked what finally persuaded enough Democrats to break with their party, Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats and helped negotiate the deal, offered a simple answer: the harm was growing too acute.\n\n\u201cI think people were saying \u2018We\u2019re not going to get what we want,\u2019\u201d on the health subsidies, Mr. King said. \u201cBut in the meantime, a lot of people are being hurt.\u201d\n\nThe group of people affected by the shutdown grew with each week, beyond the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been paid for weeks. The Trump administration\u2019s legal fight to avoid paying SNAP food assistance benefits put tens of millions of Americans at risk of going hungry. And its decision to ratchet back air traffic capacity ensnared millions of others in air travel disruptions and flight cancellations that began over the weekend.\n\nAnd even though polls showed that voters were generally blaming Republicans more for the shutdown \u2014 an assessment Mr. Trump said last week that he shared \u2014 a handful of Democrats ultimately decided enough was enough.\n\n\u201cWe must extend the A.C.A. enhanced premium tax credits, but that can\u2019t come at the expense of the millions of Americans across our country impacted by a shutdown,\u201d Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, who backed the deal, said in a statement.\n\n\n**Trump stayed on the sidelines.**\n-\n\nPresidents usually want to show that they are taking great pains to end a government shutdown, and that they will force congressional leaders to come to the table and bargain their way out of gridlock.\n\nNot so with Mr. Trump.\n\nThe president did not once invite Democratic leaders to the White House during the shutdown to negotiate. He did not travel to the Capitol to show that he was leading the way toward a solution.\n\nInstead, he stoked the impasse in social media posts in which he vehemently encouraged Republicans to hold the line, a message he communicated to G.O.P. senators in person at two gatherings at the White House. He cast Democrats as intransigent, and as the consequences of the shutdown mounted, he urged G.O.P. senators to find a way around them, including by ending the legislative filibuster.\n\nAs a deal was coming together on Sunday night, Mr. Trump was at a football game in Maryland, and his sole comment to reporters when he returned to the White House was: \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re getting very close to the shutdown ending.\u201d Still, Senator Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, said that the White House had given the deal its blessing.\n\n\n**So did Republican leaders.**\n-\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson led Republicans to pass a stopgap measure to fund the government on Sept. 19. Then, he sent it over to the Senate and told his lawmakers to head back to their districts.\n\nThere they have stayed for weeks on end, as Mr. Johnson insisted that there was no reason for him or his conference to negotiate, because the House had already done its job. In doing so, he marginalized both himself and his chamber.\n\nMr. Thune, for his part, refused to move from his initial offer: a simple stopgap spending measure that would fund the government at existing levels. Throughout the shutdown, he maintained that Democrats were being unreasonable and that there was no reason to compromise or to tie funding the government to a health care measure.\n\nHe ultimately left it to moderates in his party to cut a deal to allow the government to reopen, often sounding more like a spectator than a leader as he professed uncertainty about exactly what deal might be possible when.\n\nThe group of negotiators included Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the Republican chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, who said she was eager to return to the regular functioning of the congressional spending process.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get the job done and let\u2019s do it fast,\u201d she said.\n\n\n**Democrats notched a few gains.**\n-\n\nThough health care was their major focus, Senate Democrats won some concessions in their fight against the Trump administration\u2019s concerted effort to reconfigure and diminish the federal government.\n\nTheir biggest win was language that would restore the jobs of thousands of federal workers who were laid off during the shutdown and bar further reductions-in-force through Jan. 30, while guaranteeing back pay for hundreds of thousands of others who were furloughed, as required by law.\n\nThe group of moderate senators that negotiated an end to the shutdown also protected the Government Accountability Office, an agency that helps Congress keep track of federal spending. The G.A.O. has run afoul of Mr. Trump and his allies after it twice this year concluded that the president violated rules that prohibit him from unilaterally canceling funding.\n\nThe House\u2019s measure proposed to halve funding to the G.A.O., but the Senate\u2019s measure would keep its funding flat. It also removed language that would bar the agency from suing the White House to release illegally withheld funds.",

    "selftext":"\n\n**Article:**\n\nThe voters have spoken, but what did they say? The elections held on November 4th have consequences for how Minneapolis, New Jersey, New York City and Virginia are run; for electricity prices in Georgia and for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. They were also the first real test of whether Donald Trump\u2019s second term is everything voters hoped for when they chose last November to send him back to the White House. Overall, Democrats did even better than expected. Yet one good night has not solved the party\u2019s enduring problems.\n\n\nBegin in New York, where a 34-year-old political novice will be handed a $117bn budget when he takes office next year. Turnout was high, suggesting enthusiasm for Zohran Mamdani and his brand of socialism. This is a big win for the oligarch-bashing left of the party. Democrats who think the answer to Mr Trump is left-wing economic populism now have a new champion. But Mr Mamdani\u2019s victory does not answer the question of how Democrats should oppose Mr Trump, nor how they could win back power nationally. And that is because Democratic presidential candidates win New York City come what may. None has lost there since John Davis was defeated by Calvin Coolidge in 1924.\n\nVirginia and New Jersey, which both held governors\u2019 elections, are better places for Democrats to look for inspiration. Abigail Spanberger won in Virginia. The result was no surprise: the last time a Republican won the governorship with a Republican in the White House was in 1973. But the 15-point margin was larger than expected. The same is true in New Jersey, where polls favoured Mikie Sherrill to beat a good Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, within the margin of error. In the end she won easily. That broke a streak going back to 1961, the last time a candidate won the office after an incumbent from the same party had served two consecutive terms.\n\n\nSome Democrats will look at all this and conclude that New York\u2019s mayoral election shows that voters are fired up by the policies associated with the party\u2019s far left; that the Democratic Party is in better shape than pundits think; and that next year\u2019s midterm elections are as good as won. They would be making a mistake.\n\n\nWhat are the right lessons? The first is to focus on the economy and affordability, as Mr Mamdani, Ms Sherrill and Ms Spanberger all did. The second is to pick candidates who are a good fit for the places where they are running. Ms Spanberger worked for the CIA before she entered politics and Ms Sherrill served as a Navy helicopter pilot. Both are evidence of a patriotism that helps parry Republican attacks about America-hating Democrats. The third is not to run as a defender of the establishment in an era of upheaval. New Yorkers probably do not want socialism and Mr Mamdani will be too constrained by city and state law (as well as the laws of arithmetic) to give it to them. As a year ago, this election was less an endorsement of a programme than another expression of frustration.\n\n\nLanding a blow on the president after a year of introspection will give Democrats relief as they look towards the midterms next year. But when that fades, they will still face the same problems. Their party is associated with policies on immigration, climate change and race that are far from the views of the voters they need to win power nationwide. By choosing a democratic socialist as one of their standard-bearers, Democrats have just aggravated that problem. Mr Mamdani\u2019s joyful campaign made New Yorkers feel good, but his victory could make Republican strategists feel even better.",

    "selftext":"**Article:** \n\n(The linked article is gifted, so you can also read their chart of what seats &amp; where). \n\nOn a Friday morning in mid-October, Republican legislators in Indiana were summoned to a conference call with President Trump. Using a charm offensive rather than threats, the president implored the lawmakers to redraw their congressional maps to add two more Republican seats before the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe change was critical to retain control of Congress and continue his agenda, he said.\n\nRoughly a week later, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader, was in Illinois, making the case to Democratic lawmakers that they needed to redraw their own maps to offset the growing number of newly drawn Republican districts. The main reason to take such a partisan action, Mr. Jeffries said, was to give Democrats a fighting chance in the midterm elections as Mr. Trump tried to tilt the maps in his favor.\n\nRedrawing congressional maps ahead of a midterm election to eke out more safe seats before any votes are cast is not part of the ordinary run-up to the midterms. At such a national scale, it is a historic break from decades of settled norms regarding when and how legislative lines are drawn.\n\nYet this midcycle redistricting effort is at the center of Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy to win the midterms and prevent Democratic control of the House of Representatives, which would give Democrats the power to open investigations and thwart the president\u2019s agenda. What began over the summer in Texas, with the drawing of five new Republican-favored seats at Mr. Trump\u2019s behest, has spiraled into a nationwide redistricting arms race.\n\nThe president\u2019s aides and allies are supporting \u2014 or pressuring \u2014 lawmakers in nearly a dozen states to redraw maps, while Democrats are escalating their response and finding new avenues of countering the Republican effort to preserve their House majority of just a half-dozen seats. But the debate over drawing new maps has revealed fissures within both parties, as some Republicans are acting in rare defiance of Mr. Trump while Democrats are openly criticizing each other.\n\nThe result is a high-stakes partisan brawl playing out in nearly 20 states across the country, with control of Congress hanging in the balance. Critics of the practice also fear that it could open a Pandora\u2019s box, with parties redrawing maps on a whim at any point, undercutting democratic principles.\n\n\u201cEverybody sees the current moment as something of an existential threat,\u201d said Kareem Crayton, the vice president of the Washington, D.C., office of the Brennan Center, a think tank focused on democracy and voting rights. \u201cUsually, the president of the United States is looking around the country to try to kind of come up with a way to keep things calm and predictable. And it is pretty clear on the facts that this president has been one of the instigators of all of this.\u201d\n\nThe redrawing of legislative lines is typically done at the beginning of each decade, following the census, for the official purpose of adjusting to population changes. Both parties have used that cover to draw districts that benefit them politically, known as gerrymandering. But this year, Republicans have started that process in the middle of the decade, with the express purpose of helping them hold the House.\n\nIn making their pitch to Republican lawmakers, the president\u2019s allies have argued their party has to act because Democrats have been aggressive in using litigation to change maps.\nEditors\u2019 Picks\nA Cheapskate\u2019s Guide to Costa Rica\n2025 Holiday Gift Guide\nMartha Stewart Transformed the Dinner Party. Was That a Good Thing?\n\n\u201cRepublicans had a choice: keep playing defense as Democrats tried to sue away the Republican House majority or go on offense,\u201d Adam Kincaid, the executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, wrote in a text message. \u201cRepublicans chose to go on offense and proactively redraw in response to Democrats\u2019 lawfare.\u201d\n\nThe White House declined to comment.\n\nThough Republicans will have more opportunities to draw more seats, it is difficult to predict which side will come out ahead in the current redistricting battle. Even if seats are drawn to give one party a clear advantage, voting patterns can be unpredictable. And each state is working on its own timeline, with some adding a single seat in a matter of days with little notice, others struggling over a single seat for weeks, and some states looking for as many as five newly safe partisan seats.\n\nInitially, the White House saw the possibility of drawing as many as 16 new Republican seats.\n\nSo far, they have passed maps that could give them seven or more new Republican districts: five from Texas, one from Missouri, one from North Carolina and one to two from Ohio (though the Texas and Missouri maps are currently facing legal challenges). Florida, which could add two to four new seats, has formed a redistricting committee in the State Legislature, though it has not yet introduced any maps. Republicans could stand to gain additional seats with the Supreme Court poised to weaken the Voting Rights Act, though those seats might not be reapportioned until after the midterm elections.\n\n\n\u201cThis redistricting war is the opening salvo of a battle that must be won,\u201d Stephen K. Bannon, a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, said in an interview. \u201cWe must have these victories. If Trump doesn\u2019t hold the House, they will impeach him. It will be a nightmare and a blood bath.\u201d\n\nBut so far, Republicans\u2019 other state efforts have not gone according to plan.\n\nThe G.O.P. leader of the State Senate in Indiana, a state where Trump officials had hoped to add two seats, has repeatedly said that he does not have the votes in the upper chamber, even as the Republican governor called for a redistricting session. Republican leadership in Kansas and Nebraska, states where the White House believed they could pick up a single district in each, have also said that they do not have enough Republican legislators on board to draw maps ahead of the midterms.\n\nAnd in New Hampshire, where the White House believed they could at least make one of the state\u2019s two districts competitive, the Republican governor, Kelly Ayotte, remains opposed, even as Corey Lewandowski, a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, threatened a primary.\n\nOvercoming the Republican reticence in New Hampshire and the Midwestern states is critical for the White House. Vice President JD Vance has traveled twice to Indiana to lobby state leaders to support the new maps. Allies of Mr. Trump, including Chris LaCivita, his former campaign manager, have created an outside group called Fair Maps Indiana to \u201cstrongly support\u201d redrawing maps in Indiana.\n\n\u201cNow the real fun begins,\u201d Mr. LaCivita wrote on social media, in a taunting response to the Indiana Senate leader\u2019s statement that they did not have enough votes to redistrict.\n\nIn Missouri, Republicans pushed through a new congressional map, but opponents of the plan are trying to force a referendum that would delay putting it in place until after the midterm elections. Republicans are trying to block the referendum, and the Republican National Committee has sent staff to the state to assist in that effort, according to people familiar with the effort.\n\nAmid the Republican infighting, Democrats have found new opportunities.\n\nAt first, the only concrete plan appeared to be an effort led by California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, to change the State Constitution and draw five new Democratic seats, seeking to offset Texas\u2019s redistricting. A referendum on the plan goes before voters on Tuesday.\n\nBut in late October, Democrats in Virginia made a surprise announcement that they planned to redistrict the state, which could net the party two or three seats. In New York, where the State Constitution inhibits Democrats in seeking to redraw maps before the 2026 elections, a leading liberal law firm filed a lawsuit challenging a Republican district in Staten Island as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, setting the stage for another potential pickup.\n\nAnd a judge in Utah found that the state\u2019s congressional map with four G.O.P. seats and no Democratic ones was unconstitutional. While the newly drawn map creates a competitive seat instead of a likely Democratic flip, Democrats are counting the new map as a victory and a seat they believe they can flip in a midterm with a president currently underwater in polling.\n\nYet much like Republicans, resistance among the ranks of Democrats has stalled their efforts.\n\nIn Maryland, a state under full Democratic control where Democrats could potentially draw a map to eliminate the last remaining Republican district, Bill Ferguson, the State Senate president, sent a letter to his colleagues last week, saying his chamber would not take up redistricting, citing legal concerns, a difficult timeline and a belief that \u201cthe downside risk to Democrats is catastrophic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe certainty of our existing map,\u201d he explained, \u201cwould be undermined.\u201d\n\nA day later, Maryland\u2019s Democratic governor, Wes Moore, pushed back, telling reporters that \u201cone person cannot stop a process\u201d and that \u201ca special session is not off the table, regardless of what anyone else says.\u201d",

    "selftext":"MEMPHIS, Tenn.\u2014 When President Trump pledged to send the National Guard to Democratic-led cities such as Washington, D.C., Chicago and Portland, Ore., he met condemnation, lawsuits and large protests.\n\nThen there is Memphis, where many have welcomed the roughly 150 National Guard troops that arrived this month, mobilized by Trump as part of a federal and state crackdown on crime in the city.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for all the help I can get, I wish there was more,\u201d said John Green, who manages a candy store on Main Street. \u201cFor Lease\u201d signs hang in nearby storefronts, their windows boarded up. Business has been terrible this year, Green added, even during \u201cElvis Week,\u201d the annual celebration of the city\u2019s favorite son. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t want to come here anymore.\u201d\n\n\nDowntown, where bluffs rise above the serpentine Mississippi River, George Campbell was walking his goldendoodle, Zac, when he spotted a group of National Guard soldiers in fatigues, handguns holstered at their hips. The 64-year-old psychologist said their presence had eased fears about crime.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe. What happened? Control is what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was out of control. This is necessary.\u201d\n\nTrump has called Memphis \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d and said he would \u201crestore law and order.\u201d The Memphis Police Department recently reported that overall crime had fallen to a 25-year low, but rates remain among the highest in the country. Forming a \u201cMemphis Safe Task Force,\u201d Trump dispatched more than a dozen federal agencies and departments\u2014the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Marshals and others\u2014and the Tennessee National Guard. The task force began operations in late September with the Guard patrols starting Oct. 10, according to the city. The troops are operating under the control of Republican Gov. Bill Lee.\n\nMemphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, isn\u2019t happy about the troops, a sentiment shared by some others in the predominantly Black city. Many Memphians still remember the arrival of the National Guard, pictured with rifles and bayonets, during the political upheaval of 1968, including the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. here.\n\nBut Young, who took office in 2024 and has aggressively fought crime, has largely cooperated with the White House and Lee.

We don\u2019t want conflicts in our community.\u201d\n\n\n**Wealth and decay**\n\nSome officials hope the law-and-order push will ease Memphis\u2019s reputation as crime-ridden, a stigma the city has carried for years. Leading corporations have headquarters in the city, including FedEx and AutoZone, while Elon Musk\u2019s xAI built a major data center in Shelby County. But others have moved or closed, leaving behind empty factories and office buildings.\n\nMemphis\u2019s population dropped about 11% between 2000 and 2024, from 689,000 to 610,000, according to census data and estimates. Nashville, by contrast, has surged and is now the largest metro area in the state.\n\nParts of Memphis boast mansions and broad, manicured lawns festooned with elaborate Halloween decorations. But in other areas, graffiti covers abandoned buildings, weeds choke vacant lots and billboards advertise fentanyl-treatment programs. In one neighborhood, Orange Mound, sex workers and drug dealers ply their trades openly at midday.\n\nIn another, Frayser, stickers on a family-owned convenience store\u2019s door warn customers: no firearms, no ski masks. A manager showed a Wall Street Journal reporter security footage of groups of men firing at each other in his parking lot. Another clip showed his clerk\u2014a relative\u2014cowering behind the counter as gunfire erupted outside. A shop owner next door was shot to death last year in daylight.\n\nThe manager, whose family came to the U.S. from Yemen years ago, said he had considered returning to that country because Memphis felt dangerous. Since the federal surge, however, he notices customers have stopped bringing handguns into his store, and he doesn\u2019t hear shooting at night. He said the past few weeks are the safest he has ever felt in Memphis.\n\n\n**Tourists and troops**\n\nThe National Guard can be seen downtown these days, walking in groups of five or so, accompanied by a Memphis police officer. Guard troops won\u2019t make arrests, according to the governor\u2019s office.\n\nAmid the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 pro basketball team recent season opener, Guard troops, FBI agents, U.S. Marshals, and other authorities gathered at barricades along Beale Street, the city\u2019s famous blues hub. They posed for photos with tourists and gave directions.\n\nMarlon Dewey, 38, was visiting from rural Kansas for work. He came to Beale Street in part to catch a glimpse of the National Guard. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel needed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like a short-term fix to a long-term problem.\u201d \n\nGale Jones Carson, president of the Memphis Urban League, said many locals also question the use of the military. \u201cDo we need help with the crime in Memphis? Yes, we do,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut do we need to be invaded?\u201d \n\nA group of area politicians are suing the governor, arguing the National Guard deployment violates the Tennessee Constitution. \n\nLee Harris, the mayor of Shelby County, is at the forefront of the group. He supports the federal surge to help local law enforcement, but he is opposed to the arrival of the National Guard troops. (The Memphis mayor didn\u2019t join the litigation.)\n\n\n\u201cIf we get used to military personnel in our streets, we will be forever changed,\u201d Harris said in an interview. \u201cWe may have zero crime, but we won\u2019t be America.\u201d The governor\u2019s office maintains the troop deployment is on strong legal grounds.\n\nAt the picturesque University of Memphis, in a wealthy enclave, first-year student Claire Norwood, 18, feels reassured the troops are in town. Everyone here knows about Eliza Fletcher, the schoolteacher abducted and murdered while running near campus early one morning in 2022. Norwood usually stays on campus when she runs.\n\n\nShe hasn\u2019t seen a National Guard soldier herself, but still, she said, \u201cmost of us feel a little safer.\u201d \n\nLee said the Guard\u2019s role is support\u2014freeing up law enforcement to go after criminals. At a recent press conference, he called the early data \u201cvery encouraging.\u201d\n\nAsked when the deployment would end, he gave no timeline, saying \u201cas long as it takes.\u201d",

    "selftext":"**Article:** \n\nThe Ukrainian drone zeroed in on the two Russian soldiers riding a motorcycle just after 9 a.m. on July 19, closer and closer, until it swooped down to hit its mark and the camera went dark.\n\nIt was a high-value target for the drone operator\u2019s regiment: worth as many as 24 points, to be exact. In a real-world game run by the Ukrainian government, regiments are being rewarded with points for successful attacks.\n\nWound a Russian soldier? Eight points. Kill one? That is good for 12. A Russian drone pilot is worth more: 15 points for wounding one, and 25 points for a kill. Capturing a Russian soldier alive with the help of a drone is the jackpot: 120 points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a brutal game \u2014 human lives turned into points,\u201d said Stun, 33, a drone commander for the Ukrainian unmanned systems regiment known as Achilles. In keeping with military protocol, he goes by only his call sign.\n\nThe Ukrainian government set up the competition in August 2024, although that was more of a soft launch, a beta version. Teams compete for points to acquire Ukrainian-made gear, including basic surveillance drones and larger drones carrying powerful explosives, through an internal Amazon-style weapons store called Brave1 Market. The store first went online in April of this year and was expanded in August.\n\nThe more points a unit gets, the better stuff it can buy, ensuring that resources are directed to the teams that best use them. It is a digital-age, instant-gratification twist on time-honored rewards for soldiers like medals and promotions, with the winnings plowed back into the war effort.\n\nDrone teams submit videos of their successful strikes to a central office in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, where experts review them to decide who gets points based on time stamps and verified destruction, said Mykhailo Fedorov, the minister of digital transformation, who helped devise the program.\n\nOfficials argue that the competition keeps troops energized after three and a half years of war, with drone operators facing constant stress from witnessing violence on live video feeds.\n\n\u201cThis helps us stop the enemy,\u201d said Mr. Fedorov, the digital minister. \u201cIf this gives additional motivation to our military,\u201d he added, \u201cwe are happy to support it.\u201d\n\nWeaponized drones have long raised concerns that they dehumanize war by allowing soldiers to kill with the click of a button, at a remove from the battlefield. When asked if he thought that Ukraine\u2019s drone game might be dehumanizing, Mr. Federov shrugged. \u201cWhat is inhumane is starting a full-scale war in the 21st century,\u201d he said.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, both sides have vied for a technological edge, fielding self-destructing drones, long-range drones, jet drones, fiber-optic drones, drones that intercept other drones and, soon, swarms of drones guided by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Russians have their own version of a battlefield competition, paying bonuses like $2,400 for destroying a helicopter or $12,000 for capturing a Leopard tank.\n\nUkraine\u2019s online weapons marketplace is an extension of the do-it-yourself ethos that has defined the country\u2019s drone procurement since the start of the war, including collecting donations to buy consumer drones and hacking them to make them deadly.\n\nMore than 400 drone teams compete. Some infantry units that did not have full-fledged drone units have created them to be able to use the point system and earn equipment, soldiers said.\n\nThe contest awards points for hitting both Russian soldiers and their equipment. Demolishing a Russian multiple-launch rocket system can earn up to 70 points. Destroying a tank is worth 40 points; damaging one yields 20.\n\nAs tanks have become easy targets for drones, limiting their usefulness on the battlefield, those points have become much harder to earn.\n\n\u201cThese days, spotting enemy vehicles is extremely rare,\u201d said a drone pilot working with Stun who goes by the call sign Red and claims 45 confirmed kills. \u201cAnd if one does show up, like coming out of a forest, there\u2019s basically a line of drones waiting to strike it.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian government has adjusted the point values to respond to Russia\u2019s changing tactics.\n\nFor instance, as attack drones with ever-growing ranges widen and blur the front lines, the Russian Army often tries to gain ground by sending one, two or three infantrymen forward at a time. They move stealthily, trying to evade Ukrainian drone cameras by wearing anti-thermal coats or using greenery as cover. Those who succeed then regroup with any other Russian soldiers who make it forward.\n\nSo taking out Russian soldiers has become the priority.\n\nWhen the competition was introduced, the death of a Russian soldier earned only two points. In October 2024, that increased to six, which was doubled in May.\n\nYuriy Fedorenko, the commander of the Achilles regiment, said that Ukrainian soldiers must kill or gravely injure as many as 25,000 Russian soldiers a month. That is about the number of new recruits Russia is mobilizing monthly, he added.\n\nTo do so, Ukraine needs at least two attack drones for every Russian infantry soldier, or at least 50,000 a month, Mr. Fedorenko said.\n\n\u201cWithout exaggeration \u2014 we are cornered by Russia. Russia wants to annihilate us,\u201d Mr. Fedorenko said, adding that he did not see the war itself as a game. \u201cThe realization that successful combat operations also bring additional equipment \u2014 that inspires confidence that we will have the means to keep fighting.\u201d\n\nHe added that mastering drones had helped him expand his former company of 100 men into a battalion of 500 and now a regiment of about 3,000 that is considered one of the top drone units in Ukraine. Alongside other new drone regiments, Achilles is trying to form a united drone line along the front, strengthening reconnaissance, helping assault brigades in combat and blocking Russian reconnaissance drones.\n\nA video posted in June by Robert Brovdi, the overall commander of the unmanned systems units of the Ukrainian armed forces \u2014 a new separate branch of the military supervising drones and robot warfare \u2014 shed light on the point system and the internal online marketplace where units acquire drones.\n\nA basic kamikaze drone costs 1.3 points, Mr. Brovdi said in the video. A drone with a thermal camera runs 4.5 points. And a more advanced \u201cvampire\u201d drone, with up to 33 pounds of explosives and a range of up to 19 miles, takes 43 points.\n\nMr. Brodvi said that his former brigade, the Birds of the Magyar, had hit about 6,500 targets in May, including 2,221 Russian soldiers, earning more than 25,000 points that month. The brigade traded those points for 600 vampire drones.\n\nSo far, units across the Ukrainian military have ordered more than 80,000 drones and electronic-warfare systems using points through Brave1 Market, equipment worth more than $96 million, said Mr. Fedorov, the digital minister.\n\nAn online leaderboard lists the top 10 drone teams every month, although point totals are not made public.\n\nIn first place in September was the Birds of the Magyar, followed by the so-called Alpha Group of Ukraine\u2019s leading internal security agency. The Achilles regiment was ranked sixth.\n\nBoth commanders and soldiers say they are already motivated to destroy Russian equipment and kill Russian soldiers. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on destroying the enemy, on real objectives, on the mission,\u201d Stun, the drone commander, said. \u201cWe go where we\u2019re needed \u2014 not chasing after points.\u201d\n\nBut they said that the contest could be motivating, spurring competition among drone operators to be the first to hit a battlefield target.\n\n\u201cOf course, there were times when we\u2019d argue in chats over points,\u201d said Stun, who was given his call sign partly because his favorite move in his favorite video game was \u201cstun,\u201d which freezes enemies in their tracks.\n\n\u201cFor example, when a vehicle was hit and several units engaged it, we\u2019d argue over who got the actual hit,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019d say: \u2018That was our target! Don\u2019t touch it!\u2019 \u2018We were the first to hit it!\u2019 \u2018We did it! That was us!\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Fedorov said that the game was constantly expanding to match new technology in the war. Units can now earn points for using robotic ground vehicles on logistics missions like rescuing injured soldiers, for detecting Russian equipment with reconnaissance drones and for destroying targets using guidance systems with artificial intelligence.\n\nThere are still kinks \u2014 the system is new, after all. Some unit commanders have said that the new drones did not arrive quickly enough, and some soldiers have complained that they destroyed valuable Russian equipment that was not worth any points.\n\nThe drone pilot who goes by the name Red said that his team had been lined up recently to try to hit a Russian armored vehicle, but that another team had managed to hit it first \u2014 so no points. Red\u2019s team then turned its attention to a log raft, which is used to cross rivers, that the armored vehicle was pulling behind it.\n\n\u201cWe burned it,\u201d he said. \u201cMission accomplished. But unfortunately, no points for rafts.\u201d",

    "selftext":"**Full NYT Article:**\n\nIt took less than a week for the police to track down two of the suspects who they say broke into the Louvre and made off with eight of France\u2019s historic crown jewels. A third person, a suspected accomplice, was tracked down on Wednesday.\n\nIn all three cases, DNA was an essential part of the search.\n\nThe chief prosecutor, Laure Beccuau, said the DNA of the two men who broke into the museum and snatched $100 million worth of jewelry was found on the window and on one of the two high-powered motor scooters the thieves used to get away.\n\nThe DNA of the accused accomplice was found on the bucket of the truck-mounted mechanical ladder that was used to raise two of the thieves to the second-floor balcony of the Louvre, Ms. Beccuau said in an interview with the radio station France Info.\n\nWhile the spectacular heist may have seemed like an advertisement for the lack of security at European museums, the speed of tracking the suspects was testament to the power of DNA in police investigations in France.\n\nIt is also a sign of how sloppy the thieves were in the end, after pulling off what seemed like a well-planned robbery in one of the world\u2019s most famous museums in broad daylight. Among the objects they left behind in their haste to evade the police and security guards were a glove, a crown that they dropped, and the truck with the mechanical ladder, which they had tried unsuccessfully to set on fire.\n\nInvestigators have processed 150 forensic samples related to the crime, from the scene and from objects the thieves left behind. All three people who were arrested already had their DNA on file because of their criminal histories, mostly for theft.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that we would not have found these people if the DNA that was found at this theft hadn\u2019t matched with this database,\u201d said Ga\u00ebtan Poitevin, a criminal lawyer in Marseille whose master\u2019s thesis was on France\u2019s DNA database.\n\n\n**How does the DNA database work?**\n\nFrance\u2019s database, the National Automated Genetic Fingerprint File, had 4.4 million DNA profiles at the end of last year. Those profiles have been collected over almost three decades from people suspected or convicted of crimes, as well as people killed in natural disasters.\n\nIt has become a staple of police investigations, with forensic investigators collecting bits of saliva, sweat, hair, skin, semen and blood, then sending them to be sequenced at public and certified private labs. The labs send the results to be compared to the contents of the enormous database, looking for exact matches.\n\n\u201cIn just a few hours now, we can have a positive DNA result,\u201d said Olivier Halnais, the head of the national union of forensic police officers.\n\n**How did France\u2019s DNA database start?**\n\nFrance began its DNA database in 1998, after the serial killer Guy Georges, known as the \u201cEastern Paris killer\u201d was finally arrested.\n\nMr. Georges had been imprisoned for assaulting a woman with a weapon, and the police collected his DNA. But France had no centralized database at the time, so officers were unable to check his DNA against that found at the scenes of five murders of women who had also been raped.\n\n\nAfter his release from prison, Mr. Georges went on to rape and kill two more women. He was arrested again and eventually convicted of the murders of seven women. The case spurred the creation of a national DNA database.\n\nInitially, the database contained only the DNA of sexual offenders. But, over the next five years, it grew to include people convicted \u2014 or merely suspected \u2014 of a much wider range of crimes, including murder, terrorism, drug trafficking, assault, theft and property damage.\n\nThe process of being removed from the DNA database is so onerous that few pursue it, Mr. Poitevin said. Those who refuse to give a DNA sample face at least a year in prison and a fine of at least 15,000 euros, almost $17,400.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2022, an average of 680 people a year were convicted of refusing to provide DNA \u2014 less than one percent of people charged each year, according to the Justice Ministry.\n\n\u201cAmong my clients, absolutely zero refuse, because for them, it\u2019s an admission of guilt,\u201d said Mr. Poitevin.\n\nAs a result, the database has continued to grow. And French investigators can check the collected DNA against more than 30 other European national DNA databases, as well as others including one kept by the United States.\n\n\n**The database and cold cases**\n\nWhile the databank is used regularly for basic investigations, it has proved particularly useful in cold cases.\n\nInvestigators said DNA linked Dominique Pelicot, who was convicted last year of drugging his wife, Gisele, and inviting dozens of men to rape her, to an attempted rape committed more than two decades earlier. The 1999 attempted rape case had been dormant for years until the police arrested Mr. Pelicot in 2020, collected his DNA sample and ran it through the database, matching it to long-held samples collected at the crime scene. (Mr. Pelicot has been indicted in the attempted rape.)\n\nIn 2011, a French officer investigating a nine-year-old unsolved murder used the database to search not for perfect matches but DNA profiles that were similar. That led investigators to the father of the murderer, helping solve the crime.\n\nSuch searches for direct family members are much more time-consuming and used only for serious crimes like murder or rape, said Jo\u00eblle Vailly, a sociologist who has studied how the French judicial system uses DNA.\n\n\n**How is France\u2019s system different than the U.S. one?**\n\nThe French system is very similar to the American one, called the Combined DNA Index System, which contains more than 24.9 million DNA profiles of convicted offenders and those who have been arrested, as well as 1.4 million crime scene DNA profiles.\n\nIn recent years, American law enforcement agencies have also used consumer genealogy databases, including GEDmatch or FamilyTreeDNA, which are used by millions of people with no criminal record to find distant relatives or trace their ancestry.\n\nThese commercial databases offer police a pool of partial DNA matches that they then narrow using other techniques.\n\nThe practice of using commercial databases gained renown in 2018, when detectives used one to identify a serial killer known as the Golden State Killer.\n\nIn 2022, a Canadian researcher counted more than 800 cases in which forensic genetic genealogy was used in the United States.\n\nThree American states have passed legislation to regulate the practice, said Natalie Ram, a law professor at the University of Maryland.\n\nPrivate consumer genetics companies are banned in France, in good part because the practice of tracing one\u2019s ancestry is sensitive, Ms. Vailly said, given the country\u2019s history. The Jewish ancestry of many French citizens was used to send them to death camps during World War II.\n\nLast month, France\u2019s justice minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, said he planned to introduce legislation to allow investigators of serious crimes that have remained unsolved for more than 18 months to access data from private foreign companies, mainly American ones, specializing in genealogical testing.\n\nWhile some lawyers specializing in cold cases lauded the announcement, others called the idea hypocritical and dangerous, since such companies are outlawed in France.\n\nMs. Vailly, the sociologist, said she thought the practice of using forensic genetic genealogy infringed on privacy rights, as one person using a consumer genetics service would essentially be offering up the DNA of whole families, not to mention future generations, to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cThey become genetic suspects,\u201d she said.",

    "selftext":"**Full Article:** \n\nThe Food and Drug Administration announced on Wednesday that it would ease regulatory roadblocks for low-cost copycat versions of certain medicines.\n\nBiosimilars, as the copycats are called, are seen as a crucial way to drive down drug prices. They are akin to generics of biologic drugs that are made through complex biological processes. Some well-known blockbuster drugs are now available as biosimilar competitors, including Herceptin, for breast cancer; Lantus, a widely used insulin; and Humira, for autoimmune conditions like arthritis.\n\nThe F.D.A. said it would advise drug developers that they generally no longer need to conduct expensive and time-consuming clinical trials aimed at showing that the copycat is just as effective as the original brand-name product. The agency also said it would push to make it easier for pharmacists to swap in biosimilars when dispensing a prescription, as is standard with generics.\n\n\u201cFor too long, government bureaucracy and regulatory barriers have protected monopolies and stifled competition,\u201d Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, said at a news conference Wednesday announcing the changes.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s moves could help accelerate some biosimilars, but they stop short of addressing the most stubborn obstacles that have suppressed the copycats in the United States. The makers of brand-name drugs have used patents and lawsuits to block biosimilars from reaching the market, in some cases for years after the copycat wins F.D.A. approval. And when the copycats are introduced, they have been slow to gain market share.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really see this regulatory change as an alleviation of the real bottleneck,\u201d Brian Skorney, a drug industry analyst at the investment bank Baird, said on social media.\n\nGeneric and biosimilar drugs represent about 90 percent of Americans\u2019 prescriptions, but only a tiny fraction of drug costs. The brand-name biologics that biosimilars compete with have emerged in recent years as a huge driver of drug spending.\n\nThe makers of biosimilars often spend several years and tens of millions of dollars conducting a clinical trial to show that its version is as effective as the original brand-name version. Under the F.D.A.\u2019s proposed changes, developers would still have to show that their molecule and manufacturing process are similar.\n\nDr. Marty Makary, the F.D.A. commissioner, said at the news conference that the move would halve the current five- to eight-year timeline to win approval for a biosimilar. He said the changes would save biosimilar manufacturers tens of millions of dollars in development costs, saying that could be passed down in the form of lower costs for payers and patients.\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n10 Scary-Movie Endings That Swing Big or Pull Their Punches\n5 Disturbing Games for Halloween Weekend\nDemon Hunter or Armadillo? Store-Bought or Homemade?\n\nUnlike traditional pills synthesized through chemistry, biosimilars are made inside living cells and typically given as infusions or injections.\n\nWhen the first biosimilar was approved in 2015, there was widespread hope that the class would drastically drive down drug costs. More than 60 biosimilar products are now on the market in the United States. But biosimilars have been slow to gain traction, and drug spending has continued to increase.\n\nIn his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Kennedy accused brand-name drugmakers of lobbying to stymie biosimilars to protect their profits. \u201cThe pharmaceutical industry rigged the rules,\u201d he said.\n\nPhRMA, the lobbying group that represents brand-name drugmakers, said in a statement on Wednesday that the real problem in the biosimilar market was different. The group blamed industry middlemen \u2014 giant companies known as pharmacy benefit managers \u2014 for often excluding biosimilars from their lists of covered medicines.",

    "selftext":"\\*\\*Article:\\*\\*\n\nProlonged shutdowns\u00a0of America\u2019s federal government have never gone well for the party the public sees as provoking them. On all three previous occasions when a shutdown has lasted at least a week, the perceived instigators\u2014Republicans in each case\u2014were blamed and failed to extract any serious policy concessions. This time Republicans accuse the Democrats of holding\u00a0[routine federal services](https:\/\/www.economist.com\/united-states\/2025\/09\/30\/your-federal-government-is-now-closed-for-business)\u00a0hostage. Yet so far the Democrats do not appear to be paying any political price. In fact, the earliest evidence suggests that they may even have gained a slight edge in the messaging battle.\n\nShortly before the shutdown began on October 1st, YouGov, a pollster, asked respondents which party they would hold more responsible if a deal was not reached. One-third of participants said the Republicans, 27% the Democrats. In the latest survey, conducted October 4th through 6th, the share blaming the Democrats rose by three percentage points, to 30%. The proportion naming the Republicans as the main culprit, however, jumped eight points to 41%. The Democrats\u2019 net advantage over the Republicans rose from six points to 11.\n\nNow that the shutdown is a reality, Democratic and Republican respondents have begun to move off the fence\u2014away from blaming \u201cboth sides equally\u201d or saying they\u2019re \u201cnot sure\u201d\u2014and into their expected camps. But Democratic opinion has hardened more than Republican opinion. Some 85% of those who voted for Kamala Harris blame the Republicans, against 4% who blame the Democrats\u2014an 81-point gap.\u00a0 Donald Trump\u2019s voters were less united to begin with: last week they blamed the Democrats more than the Republicans by a comparatively modest 51 points, a lead that has since widened to 60. Just 12% of Ms Harris\u2019s voters now say they blame both sides equally or are unsure, compared with 23% of Mr Trump\u2019s.\n\n  \nDemographic breakdowns tell a similar story. Among Republican-leaning groups such as men and white people, blame remains roughly evenly divided between the two parties.\u00a0 Democrats, by contrast, started out with an advantage in their core constituencies and have expanded it as the shutdown wears on. Over the past week, the margin by which participants blaming Republicans exceeded those blaming Democrats rose by nine percentage points among women, 18 points among Hispanics and 22 among blacks.\n\nDemocrats may not enjoy this advantage in party unity for long. Large shares of the president\u2019s supporters tend to embrace whatever position his administration espouses. For example, following a recent speech about physical fitness in the armed forces by Pete Hegseth, the secretary of war, 56% of YouGov respondents who recalled voting for Mr Trump said that they considered overweight generals and admirals to be a serious problem. Now the message being put forth by the administration is that congressional Democrats care more about expanding health-care benefits for undocumented immigrants than about existing government health programmes. So far it hasn\u2019t caught on: in a separate YouGov poll just 22% of self-identified Republicans said they believe this. But if the president and his allies begin to push this message harder, that number could rise quickly.\n\nFortunately for Democrats, they also seem to have an edge in the middle of the electorate. Independents said they blamed Republicans more than Democrats by a margin of 41% to 17%; the margin was 31% to 18% before the shutdown began. Self-described moderates are moving in a similar direction. The Democrats\u2019 advantage among this group has widened from 11 points (30% to 19%) last week to 22 points (39% to 17%) now. If the Democrats continue to gain ground with these constituencies, shutting down the government to force a change in policy might work for the first time.",

    "selftext":"**Summary: (AI Generated for ease)**   \nThis discussion between Frank Bruni, Nate Silver, and Kristen Soltis Anderson paints the ongoing federal shutdown as a\u00a0low-stakes political standoff with high noise but little public engagement. Both parties are unpopular and struggling to control the narrative. Democrats appear\u00a0divided and inconsistent in message, while Republicans are\u00a0more unified but risk being undermined by Trump\u2019s anti-government rhetoric.\n\nPolling shows Americans\u00a0blame Republicans slightly more,though most voters simply dislike everyone involved. Public attention remains shallow since few people feel the direct effects yet. Analysts agree the outcome is unlikely to reshape long-term political dynamics \u2014\u00a0Trump\u2019s approval remains steady, partisanship is entrenched, and messaging failures on both sides blunt any clear victory.\n\nUltimately, the shutdown reflects a\u00a0wider political malaise:parties talking past the public, low trust in leadership, and politics driven more by symbolic fights and \u201cmeme wars\u201d than by substance. The smart money says the shutdown will\u00a0end soon, forgotten quickly, and leave the underlying dysfunction untouched.\n\n**TL;DR bullets**\n\n* **Public Opinion:**\u00a0Voters are frustrated with both parties; no one is winning the messaging war. Slightly more people blame Republicans and Trump, but that margin is narrowing.\n* **Polling Context:**\u00a0Approval for all parties and leaders (Trump, Democrats, Republicans) is low and fairly static. Voters aren\u2019t paying much attention yet, as the shutdown hasn\u2019t deeply affected daily life.\n* **Democratic Messaging:**\u00a0Democrats are divided on purpose and strategy \u2014 unclear whether the fight is over health care, Trump, or principle. Their messaging lacks coherence and hasn\u2019t broken through.\n* **Republican Position:**\u00a0Republicans are unusually unified this time and benefit from being seen as \u201cin charge,\u201d though Trump\u2019s \u201cshrinking government\u201d rhetoric could undermine that.\n* **Impact of Messaging:**\u00a0Normal voters are disengaged; the shutdown feels like an \u201cinsider game.\u201d Real political consequences may only come if tangible pain (missed paychecks, airport delays) emerges.\n* **Trump\u2019s Role:**\u00a0His approval is steady and mostly immune to events like this. Any dips are minor and driven more by economic concerns than the shutdown itself.\n* **Democratic Dilemma:**\u00a0Schumer is unpopular and in a tough position\u2014must appear strong but risks overplaying his hand. The party lacks a clear, trusted spokesperson.\n* **Strategic Irony:**\u00a0By fighting to preserve health-care subsidies now, Democrats may be preventing Republicans from politically self-sabotaging later.\n* **\u201cMeme Wars\u201d and Media:**\u00a0Social media hasn\u2019t shaped shutdown narratives yet but could if visible consequences start.\n* **Outlook:**\u00a0Shutdown expected to last about two weeks, give or take; long-term effects likely minimal. Both parties\u2019 leadership remains vulnerable but entrenched.\n* **2027 Forecast:**\u00a0GOP\u2019s John Thune likely remains Senate majority leader; Democrats face uphill Senate math.",

    "selftext":"\n\n**Article:** \n\nIsraeli and Hamas representatives were expected to start negotiations in Egypt on Monday in the most serious diplomatic push for a Gaza truce in recent months, as President Trump sought to advance his ambitious vision for the territory.\n\nThe two sides, who refuse to speak directly, will rely on Qatari, Egyptian and American mediators to ferry messages back and forth in an attempt to bridge significant gaps.\n\nU.S. officials have expressed optimism that part of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan could be achieved quickly: a Hamas release of hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and an Israeli withdrawal from parts of Gaza.\n\nBut even with Mr. Trump pressuring both sides to reach a deal quickly, analysts cautioned that persistent sticking points could sink the chances for a diplomatic breakthrough.\n\nTuesday marks two years since the war began, ignited by the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The two sides have been negotiating for most of the past two years without reaching an agreement to end the war.\n\nIsraelis and Palestinians are experiencing a mix of emotions, from hope to disbelief to anxiety, over the developments of the past week, which could end the war \u2014 or lead to another disappointing dead end.\n\n**What does the Trump plan envision?**\n\nAfter months of deadlock, Mr. Trump presented a sweeping plan last week to end the fighting and free the remaining hostages. At least 20 living hostages and the bodies of about 25 others are believed to still be in Gaza.\n\nIsrael\u2019s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 people, including thousands of children, according to local health officials. The Hamas-led attack on Israel that started the war killed roughly 1,200 people, and about 250 were taken hostage.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has said he backs Mr. Trump\u2019s plan. On Friday, after Mr. Trump leveled an ultimatum to Hamas to agree to the deal, the Palestinian militant group announced that it was prepared to release all of the hostages under the terms of the plan.\n\n\nBut Hamas\u2019s response was vague on many of Mr. Trump\u2019s other demands. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal would see Hamas lay down its weapons, for example, which Hamas\u2019s statement did not address.\n\nMr. Trump said Hamas\u2019s answer showed it was \u201cready for a lasting PEACE\u201d and exhorted Israel to immediately stop bombing Gaza to allow the deal to advance. Israel ordered its troops in Gaza focus on defensive rather than offensive operations, according to Israeli officials.\n\nThe negotiations in Egypt will focus on the first part of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan: freeing remaining hostages in exchange for Israel\u2019s release of Palestinian prisoners and withdrawal from parts of Gaza.\n\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal, the hostages would be exchanged for 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences for militant activity and 1,700 Gazans detained during the war. Each dead Israeli captive would be exchanged for the bodies of 15 Gazans.\n\nIsraeli forces will also withdraw to an agreed-upon line, but still be inside Gaza\u2019s borders.\n\nMr. Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that Israel will not accept any agreement in which Hamas refuses to surrender its arms.\n\n\u201cThis will happen either diplomatically, according to Trump\u2019s plan, or militarily \u2014 at our hands,\u201d he on Saturday, adding, \u201cThis will be achieved the easy way or the hard way, but it will be achieved.\u201d\n\n**What are the biggest sticking points?**\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s proposal, which will form the basis for the talks in Egypt, can broadly be divided into two parts: the hostage release deal and the vision for postwar Gaza. Both are full of potential stumbling blocks that could torpedo a deal.\n\n\nOne major issue will be how far Israeli forces withdraw during the initial phase, when Hamas is to hand over the hostages. Another issue will be how long Hamas has to gather the hostages and the bodies of the dead. Under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, it would return them all within 72 hours of the cease-fire.\n\nIsraeli and Hamas officials have both said that deadline could be unrealistic and the group needs more time, particularly to find and dig up hostages who were killed.\n\n\nThe two sides will likely disagree over which Palestinian prisoners would be released. Hamas could demand that Israel place senior Palestinian leaders, such as Marwan Barghouti, on the list, but Israel would be reluctant to accept.\n\n\nEven if Israel and Hamas work out the details of the exchange, it is unclear whether Hamas is willing to accept many of Mr. Trump\u2019s postwar conditions.\nUnder the American plan, Hamas would have to disarm, which it has refused to do in the past. The proposal calls for an international security force, which Hamas officials have rejected as foreign meddling in Palestinian affairs.\n\n\nIf Hamas freed the hostages before working out those details, the group would be giving up what it views as its main leverage with Israel.\n\nEfforts to halt the fighting in Gaza have previously ended in frustration. Israel and Hamas have agreed only to temporary cease-fires before: for about a week in November 2023 and for less than three months earlier this year.\n\n**Who will be negotiating in Egypt?**\n\nThe negotiations in Egypt are planned in Sharm al-Sheikh, a tourist resort on the Red Sea. They will likely involve representatives of Israel, Hamas, Egypt, Qatar, and the United States.\n\nIsrael\u2019s delegation includes representatives from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s inner circle, as well as military and intelligence officials. The team is led by Ron Dermer, one of the prime minister\u2019s closest advisers. It was not immediately clear when he would join the talks in Egypt.\n\nHamas said its negotiators arrived in Egypt on Sunday night, led by Khalil al-Hayya, one of the group\u2019s leaders. Mr. al-Hayya was one of the Hamas officials who was targeted in the Israeli bombing of Doha, Qatar, last month, but he survived. His son and an aide were killed.\n\nSteve Witkoff, President Trump\u2019s envoy to the Middle East, and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, were also expected to head to the talks.",

    "selftext":"My child (17) has an end of school dinner\/celebration. They aren\u2019t finishing school for good, however that particular school finishes at their current grade and the whole grade are changing schools next year, hence the end of school event. \nMy child (who has a few social issues and has had a very rough year) didn\u2019t want any parents attending at all however school rules state the students must attend with a parent\/carer\/significant adult (they can bring a maximum of two). I didn\u2019t want to go alone so encouraged my child to think of someone else to invite. They don\u2019t have much contact with their dad at the moment, so I suggested one of their grandparents (one of my parents). My child was adamant they didn\u2019t want anyone else to come. Days later I asked again and my child told me I could ask a specific family friend knowing that person would be good company for me on the night. However now my mother (child\u2019s grandmother) is very upset that she \nwasn\u2019t asked and that someone from outside the family has been asked. My mother is talking about the event as a graduation and is hurt that she doesn\u2019t get to attend her first grandchild\u2019s graduation. I never thought of the event in the same way and as such haven\u2019t attached the same meaning to it and therefore didn\u2019t think that who was asked would be a big deal. I was trying to make the event as easy as possible for my child and for me (I don\u2019t know any other parents at the school). When my mother told me how hurt she was I did ask her to come but she now doesn\u2019t want to as she wasn\u2019t the first choice. \nI have two questions: \n1) AITA for not considering her feelings in this; 2) should I now just deal with the awkwardness of going alone so that we\u2019re not taking someone that isn\u2019t family",

I think if I knew how much meaning my mother was attaching to this I would have already had the conversation with my child and strongly encouraged them to invite a grandparent. I can acknowledge that the difference in perspectives on the meaning of the event has caused the issue. \n\nI have thought about talking to my child but I\u2019m not sure what would be achieved given my mother has said she now won\u2019t come anyway even if invited as she would be second choice.

    "selftext":"I\u2019m a 36 (F) introvert with GAD and panic attacks. I\u2019ve worked hard to manage it, and you wouldn\u2019t know if I didn\u2019t tell you. My husband (43 M) is very close with his family. His parents live 6 hours away, and 2x a year we go down for big family gatherings. We usually stay 5 full days plus 2 travel days. We used to stay at his aunt\u2019s, but now we stay with his parents. They have two extra bedrooms: one closed-door room that my brother-in-law and his wife use, and the other is a loft where my husband and I sleep. The loft has no door. You can\u2019t see into it, but you can hear everything. My husband snores, sometimes so loud that at home I end up in our spare room. When we visit, there is constant socializing. We go house to house with the same large extended family all day. My social battery drains fast, and I take alone walks to avoid getting overstimulated. I love his family. But I have a very hard time sharing bathrooms. I deal with severe constipation and get extremely self-conscious spending so much time in someone else\u2019s bathroom. My in-laws have one common bathroom and another inside their bedroom, which they don\u2019t mind people using, but I feel awkward going in there. My MIL also has a chronic cough that\u2019s much worse in the mornings. For the past few years, sleeping there has been incredibly difficult..between my husband\u2019s snoring and her coughing, I\u2019m awake multiple times a night\/morning. She tries to stay in her room longer so she doesn\u2019t wake us, but because the loft has no door, every sound travels. I use earplugs and a noise machine, and I still get jolted awake. The TV room is directly under the loft, so once people wake up, I hear everything. My husband tells me I can \u201cgo up to the loft\u201d for alone time, but that feels strange when we\u2019re there to visit. At home I need quiet time after social events to decompress. On these trips, I get almost no alone time and barely any real sleep. My anxiety spirals. I want to enjoy visiting his family. I have a stressful job and limited vacation time, and I use a big chunk of it for these visits. I come back more drained than when I left. So I asked my husband if I could get a hotel room just to sleep. The hotel is less than two miles away. I\u2019d spend the whole day with his family, but at night I\u2019d have quiet, a bathroom I can actually use, and the ability to mentally \u201cturn off.\u201d When I brought it up, he said: \u201cYou\u2019re not getting a hotel room, that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d and \u201cDo you know how hurt my parents would be?\u201d He told me I \u201cneed to get over this stuff.\u201d His solution was sleeping in the walk-in closet, which is even more ridiculous. He says he wants me there as his wife, but I need him to consider my mental and physical health. When I don\u2019t sleep, everything suffers. AITA for spending a few nights (not xmas Eve) in a hotel so I can actually sleep and, honestly, poop in peace? I\u2019m looking for outside perspectives on how to do this without offending his family while still taking care of myself.\n\nEdit: my husband offered to stay in the closet because he wants me there so bad.",

After thinking about it he just wants me happy and comfortable. He has always been very caring and considerate so this was very upsetting. He knows his mom is very emotional and was worried about her but knows my health and well being are more important. He was there for me when my anxiety was so bad I couldn\u2019t leave the house but it\u2019s been very good (with a lot of work) for two years. He admitted that he forgets that I have an anxiety disorder and autoimmune because I handle it so well. I booked the hotel room and we are going to talk to his mom tomorrow. This was my very first post and it gave me the balls to do what I need for myself. I am going to tell his mom it\u2019s all about me not her, my stomach issues, social anxiety, and sleeping issues with his snoring. I will tell her she\u2019s an amazing host but this is something I need and I will only not see her when it\u2019s bed time. If you like I will update you with what she says.
