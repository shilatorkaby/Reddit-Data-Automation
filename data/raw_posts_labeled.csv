Beyond that basically all the issues the original game had are still present.  You still cant use an ability without breaking.  You still cant bind the spin attack to a button.  You still cant do more than 1 stadium after city trial.  Top ride feels like even more of an after though, with all the items just having been copy pasted over from the other modes.  The game over all still suffers from a lack of content that the first game had.

1p0gifc,unpopularopinion,kill OR murder OR shooting OR stabbed OR bomb attack OR violent attack,t3chexpert,Expedition 33 is mediocre and does not deserve all the hype,"In fact it is so overhyped and all the positive comments are so generic that I would go as far to say that the games creators are using bots to fake the hype.

Look, I have been playing games for 30 years now and I also, both, make games AND work in the industry (I make game engines - tools) and I have never seen such hype for a game that is so mediocre in ALL fronts.

First things first, yes the game is pretty and the music is good ... but apart from that:

The combat:  The game is generic turn-based slop because it removes almost all forms of meaningful strategy, that most turn-based games have, replacing them with a parry and dodge mechanic (literally the worst part of souls-like games\* I will explain this further down) that is mediocre at best. By default the parry is set as R1 / RT button that takes longer to trigger and some controllers might not have the best response time alongside the fact that the music by default is too damn loud and the supposed audio queues for the enemies attack varies in each move / monster - if you add the input latency of the display (and if it's an older TV without a game-mode it's even worst) you have no clue when the boss strikes next turn - you would have to repeat the same encounter multiple times - essentially dying - just to learn the correct timing to trigger the parry / dodge. This is BAD DESIGN. The design choice of the Soul's games to implement a dodge and parry in such a way is a compromise they have to make so that the production of the combat sequence is faster and cheaper - because more complex behavior that both uses the nature of the media (that being theatrical and at a distance) and a better and more direct way to communicate the attack would significantly extend production times and animation times. So both the souls games and especially this slop-fest use simple timings and a swinging motion to signal and incoming attack and then because the resources are limited and the publicly available animation systems usually SUCK the developers do not put in the work to mitigate the latency - to create faster animations or better animation blending techniques to be able to even parry the attack in the last frame. Then they let the player just die a thousand times just to learn the animation sequences. This is down-right pathetic design.

The story: is overly dramatic. It's Anime drama-slop retrofitted in a western setting. The game also forces you to the story without letting you explore and be introduced to the world via your actions. This is again a result of a limited budget - development and does not belong to a supposed GOTY - in fact it is the equivalent of a movie cutting budget and throwing you into putting in a scene where a character catches you up to all the lore. In Red Dead Redemption 2 there is a mainline story but the story with the biggest impact is written via your existence in the game's world through environmental story-telling and a factor of immersion that eclipses the spoon-feeding of Expedition 33.

The game's world: can be somewhat creative at times but the PS2 style of traveling from one pointless corridor to another pointless corridor is not a cognitive design choice - it's a measure that HAD to exist to cut down on work and patch-up the game.

All these ""design"" choices create a frustrating mix that does not go well with people that don't like the Soul's gerne of really punishing games for reasons of just being punishing and people that don't like turn-based games.

They essentially took all the worst parts of a turn based game (limited interactivity - lack of fluidity - lack of continuity - lack of realistic interaction) and removed the good parts while introducing the worst part of games like Elden Ring (basing the entire game logic on punishing gameplay revolving around a parry and a dodge). And people are calling it GOTY of 2025?! Did these people even play KCD2 or other games in general or are they just riding the hype-train because their favorite slop-tuber (like asmongold and the lot) told them it's great while having a really limited library of ""premium"" (actually not f2p slop - but bought) games?

A lot of the time they're just recycling old jokes/memes instead of coming up with original concepts/jokes themselves. And they're painfully unfunny and poorly executed, simply relying on reaction faces to land the 'punchline'.

It seems like internet humor as a whole is on life support. Meme culture is pretty much dead and webcomics are circling the drain. YT/tiktok is an algo driven hellscape and social media sites are glorified fighting pits with terminally online humans instead of pit bulls. Seems like internet culture contracted some sort of terminal illness in 2019, from which it will likely never recover.

1pcwwsf,unpopularopinion,they are animals OR vermin OR subhuman OR cockroaches OR parasites,acrobaticpussy,You SHOULD care when people spread lies about you.,"I’ve come across a lot of people throughout my life who very confidently claim that if someone spread something bad about them, they’d only care if it’s true. This makes absolutely zero sense to me. 

I had a coworker tell people we had sex even though we never did. My other coworkers called me a slut and treated me way worse because of it. When I kept denying that we ever slept together, several of them responded with, “If it’s not true, then why do you care?” 

????? Because I’m getting treated like shit over a lie????? If I actually had slept with my coworker, I wouldn’t care at all if people discussed it. I’d just think they’re weird for getting offended by two single, age-appropriate coworkers banging.

An angry customer once wrote me a bad Yelp review and claimed I did unsanitary things to her food even though I definitely did not. An old coworker snitched on me to our boss for being late even though I was actually on time. An ex-frenemy once wrote the new student at school an obsessive, creepy love letter and claimed it was from me. Every single one of them, when confronted, said, “If you know it’s not true, why do you care?” 

This mentality seems pretty omnipresent online too. Whenever I see some influencer under fire for something problematic and they deny it, the top comments are always, “You denying the accusation just proves that you’re guilty. If you were actually innocent, you wouldn’t care that we’re accusing you.” Yeah… they totally shouldn‘t be upset that tens of thousands of strangers online are hating on them and potentially ruining their careers over something that never happened…

Also, literally everyone I’ve ever met who claims this mentality ends up SUPER pissed when they finally do get a lie spread about them. I’ve yet to see anyone truly just brush it off when a false accusation comes their way. I’m just so confused why so many people genuinely believe they’d handle false accusations well??

1pcjgpj,TrueOffMyChest,kill OR murder OR shooting OR stabbed OR bomb attack OR violent attack,Cold_Advance_6315,I sustained a concussion 6 months ago. I wouldn’t wish this fate on anyone.,"6 months ago, I went out drinking, blacked out, and woke up the next morning with the worst hangover of my life. At least, I thought I was just hungover. Until I looked in the mirror and noticed a swollen lump on my forehead. I don’t remember what caused my injury, but in my drunken state, I had sustained a concussion.

The next few weeks were torture. My cognition was markedly slowed down, I had no control over my emotions, and my entire nervous system was completely out of whack. I went to the doctor, and there was little they could do besides tell me to eat healthy, exercise to the best of my ability, and get quality sleep.

Daily severe headaches made normal functioning impossible. Eventually I was referred to a physical therapist to help with neck issues, as most concussion injuries also cause whiplash or other neck problems. It didn’t really help.

Over the next few months, some of my symptoms subsided. Headaches come and go, and my cognition is back to 80-90% of where I was before. But my body is still carrying so much trauma. I’m stuck in fight-or-flight all the time. Panic attacks with no obvious trigger are a frequent occurrence. I’m trying to do everything right, I should be fully recovered by now, my initial injury wasn’t even that bad. Everyone else thinks I'm completey back to normal, but I'm barely holding it together.

I feel like a shell of myself. I can't imagine living the rest of my life like this, but at this point, I think this is as good as it gets.

1pc4tfj,TrueOffMyChest,kill OR murder OR shooting OR stabbed OR bomb attack OR violent attack,LibertarianCunt,This existence is exhausting.,"Not asking for money, understanding, pity, advice or anything of that sort. I just need to get this out and I can't really do that to the few people I interact with.

To explain lots of issues would require years of backstory which i honestly don't care to give. To sum up: mental issues, back and joint issues and as of last year heart issues (9-ish heart attacks as of july 30th of last year, heck had 1 the night before thanksgiving)

Over the years i've made mistakes, gone down roads that I shouldn't have, you know, the kinda things stupid kids do because theyre stupid. That along with my other issues have made it so I cant even work at something as simple as a call center.

back around 2010 my dad died, inherited a house and some seed money. My poor choice in a woman helped me spend $150k in under 3 years. yes, i know. that's why i said helped. Was buy jewelry lots and reselling for income, that carried us for a while. She cheated and left after the money ran out. i scraped by for a few years, utilities off more often than on. went through a few rentees for one of the rooms in my house. nice waking up to a knife in your face, not gonna lie.

struggled along for a bit more then had another rentee, someone i knew for a while. she moved in and it eventually bloomed to something more. we did alright, some hard times here and there but we were content. found real love. it's nice. something that fills you in places you didn't know were empty. then a few more years later, cancer diagnoses. TNBC, uncurable, a few years max. we do the whole experimental treatments, driving hours round trip a few times a month. eventually she has a seizure, i freak out and call 911. pretty sure they broke her ribs doing cpr even though she didnt need it. in a state of shock i respond to a phone call from the hospital about her phones passcode and give it, find out they called her kids in another state. they visit her in the hospital and i'm kept out of everything. apparently while i was getting hospice for in-home care set up, they were goin about killin her. one day when i'm getting ready to visit, i get a call from one of her kids. ""we've started euthanasia, might wanna get down here"" No last words for me to her, no things i could talk to her about. i was just going about it like she'll be in there for a few days and will take care of her until she passes at home. nope. lost my mind for about a year and a half after watching her take her last breaths. its a unique sound that *sticks*. eventually after a suicide attempt that shouldnt have failed a friend moved in, and since i was somewhat stable i allowed this. after moving a lot of stuff out of the spare room i had a cluster of heart attacks. The rot just.......continues. there's no better, there's no helping it. just the slow decline with everything.....getting worse. the mind is deleting things that shouldnt be forgotten, the body is failing, the soul shattered like glass with pieces falling and the flame beyond is out. and all i can be is a leech. I cant improve myself or others, i can't do anything but be a drain. It's exhausting on a level I hope most people never understand. playing the part only goes so far. 

I'm Tired.

Edit: there's lots more I could include, like the roof failing the ceiling having a wet spot that grows or the fact the house flood every heavy rain, but comparatively , it's inconsequential.

1pc1c5q,TrueOffMyChest,kill OR murder OR shooting OR stabbed OR bomb attack OR violent attack,Unknowncat_1,i’m in love with my bestfriend,"i’m 18F, and currently 9 months pregnant with my first child. This wasn’t something planned, however just know I am able to support myself, and have a healthy support system even though that did take me a couple months to find the help and assistance. I have just stopped working as I’m at term and the baby can come at any time!

I never thought id fall in love with him as I have, and I genuinely have nobody to tell this to.

Onto what’s important, I’m in love with my best friend. I love him dearly, he’s been there for me every step of the way during my pregnancy. He came as I was still in contact with the father of my child, and he was supporting me as a good friend as I moved closer to him after I moved out of my parents place. We hung out everyday, he would come over and cuddle me while i struggled to make amends with the fact I’m in this by myself. We would watch movies and he’d hold my hair while I threw up at 4 am in the morning lol. My morning sickness is thankfully fixed though! I don’t have my license yet as I want to be able to get through this pregnancy and then go for my test, so he takes me absolutely anywhere I need to be.

He’s taken me and has been there for every appointment, every hospital visit (my pregnancy has been pretty high risk due to the fact I have bled at the 6 month mark). He’s slept in the hospital with me for two days and never left my side, he’s constantly coming over when he’s free and even got a job with me so i feel more comfortable working while pregnant knowing he’s there. We have been friends for a year and a half now, we actually started as friends with benefits a long time ago but cut communication after we had a falling out even though we both liked each-other we were extremely immature and petty.

Now we do everything a couple does, he gives me back massages, he rubs my shoulders when i’m sore, if i can’t do something due to discomfort or pain he’s there to pick up the slack. We don’t live together but he does come over everyday when he is free to spend time with me. His mum and him are currently looking for a home to buy as they have just sold their last place, his mum and I get along amazing and she calls me her daughter. She had asked if id like to move in with them when they find a place, I asked him if that’s okay with him and he’s more then happy for me to come live with him even saying he’ll provide for me.

We are not officially together, but we do everything a couple does. I love him, I haven’t told him I love him and neither has he, he says it’s going to take him a long time to love again due to his previous relationship and he cares about me however he doesn’t want to rush anything. This is completely fine with me as I can see how much I mean to him and I try to spoil him and love him through my actions.

I have never trusted someone as much as I trust him, I’ve got a horrible childhood but id like to believe I’m healed, or accepted what’s happened and moved on. I do struggle to trust anybody, as paranoia and anxiety do tend to linger no matter what I do or how i try to convince myself. We have fought over my insecurities when it comes to him leaving, as he can be cold and stand off just because he’s tired.

I love him so much, I adore him, everything he’s done for me is greatly appreciated and I don’t know how to continue. I love him so much and I want to do what’s right for us, I want to tell him I’m in love with him, I want to show him I’m in love with him. Whenever I look at him or see a message saying he’s outside of the house I get all nervous and excited to see him. I have never felt this way before and I don’t want to ruin it, I love him dearly, I want to make him happy and sometimes i don’t listen to him and it’s something i’m trying to work on.

I have been having some of the worse panic attacks and have been taking my anger stress and frustrations on him, which has made him go quiet or frustrated with me to the point he will ignore me. It’s not his fault, it’s my fault as I need to work on this as I want us to be able to communicate. I feel horrible, I love him so much and I wish i could tell him, I just don’t want to scare him away. I know my baby, my education and job will always be my priority, and I don’t have an expectation for him to father my child. I love him as he is and I have never loved someone who’s so caring before.

I keep self sabotaging because i’m scared, i’m really scared, I don’t want to lose him, I just want to tell him i love him and want to spend the rest of my life with him. He’s everything i want and more, he means the world to me. He’s literally gonna be in the delivery room as my one support person. I adore him.",1764656885.0,4,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pc1c5q/im_in_love_with_my_bestfriend/,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pc1c5q/im_in_love_with_my_bestfriend/,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False
1pbxw02,TrueOffMyChest,kill OR murder OR shooting OR stabbed OR bomb attack OR violent attack,nowheretogofromheree,I don’t like my parents,"I could’ve had a good life I could’ve been happy I could’ve been literally anything other than what I am today. And it’s their fault it’s all their fault and it pisses me off. I love my parents, I do. But I don’t like them. Sometimes I can’t feel anything but hate for them and it makes me feel like shit. 

I was born into poverty. My parents were about $30k in debt, my father was never home and when he was he wasn’t really *there*. He was emotionally and physically distant. Sometimes it felt like he’d rather drink himself to death than be around my siblings and I, and it still feels that way. We’d have no food in the fridge, but there’s still be cartons and bottles of alcohol, and my parents would still chainsmoke a packet of cigarettes a day. 

Every night they’d get drunk off their ass, then scream at eachother, then at us. My father used to beat my brother and I, my older brother got the brunt of it, I got a lot but not as much as him, and my younger sister wasn’t really hit. My parents had their good moments, but they don’t really outweigh the bad, because if they did I wouldn’t have panic attacks when people raise their voices and I wouldn’t flinch when I messed up. 

My dad has broken stuff just to intimidate me or my siblings. He’s thrown cups or shattered them on a surface to make a point or punched things or snapped things. It’s like he wanted to be a big man or something. I grew up learning to not show fear and to not cry because it’ll make it worse. Even now I don’t like showing fear infront of people, and crying physically hurts. Every emotion I feel has anger under it, I’m always so fucking angry and it’s his fault. If I’m scared I get angry, if I’m sad I get angry, if I’m happy I still feel angry. 

I remember around the same time my dad was kicked out of my house for a bit and when my parents got really bad, my mother’s friend was living with us. He wasn’t a particularly good person (he was a druggie) but he was the most stable male figure and adult figure me and my siblings had in our lives for a long time. I still think about him and I don’t think I can ever get over his betrayal: getting my father fired, buying stuff to make drugs and ordering them to my house, getting kicked out for it. I miss him, but I don’t. He hurt my mum and I can’t forgive him for that. 

My father was a narcissistic abusive angry man of a drunk but my mum was emotionally unstable and honestly kind of crazy. She would literally threaten to kill herself to my siblings and I when she got emotional, I would stay up at night listening to hear if she’s doing anything bad to herself. Even now I’m afraid that she’s going to leave us, our whole childhood she had threatened to leave us. She came home an hour late the other day and I honestly thought she actually left us. 

Sometimes I wonder if my relatives knew. If they knew what me and my siblings were going through, if they saw the hell we were put through our whole lives and decided to do nothing about it. They had to have known, right? All those nights spent at my aunties or grandparents houses had to have been a clue? So why didn’t they do anything? Why was it my siblings vs the world.

Capitalism monetizes every lack and every need. Including mine. And capitalism abuses people for my needs to be met. It’s a never-ending cycle of hurt and abuse. 

Yesterday I had a bit of a panic attack due to this thought. 

I want to buy new clothes. I’ve tried thrifting before and I simply don’t like it (I think how, no matter what, a person suffered while they made the garment of clothing I’m trying on). Even if I get new clothes, a person suffered/was abused in the process. It literally pains me, I feel dizzy/nauseous, and like a monster for wanting things, because I know that they cost suffering. 

I know I’m not 100% responsible for the capitalism and how the system I was born into is set up. That being said, I’m partially responsible and compliant whenever I buy something. 

It doesn’t matter what I buy or what I do: if I buy coffee at a local shop, I’m not being sustainable by getting coffee on a plastic cup and the workers there are not being paid enough; if I buy from a specific food brand, I’m giving money to a company that wants to privatize water. 

Like, I’m painfully aware of what it costs me to function in the system, if that makes sense? And how my actions impact the planet. Yet I know that my actions barely make a difference, millions of people need to organize so we can all make a collective change.

The most simple solution would be to grow my own food, make my own clothes, etc. And I really want to someday, but right now I’m very young and I’m still getting my education and trying to make my way in the world, by also being affected by capitalism: I study and work, I barely sleep, I need coffee and clothes to feel a little bit better emotionally, etc. 

That’s it. I think that my anxiety only multiplies the effect my actions have, but I could also be right and the world/system is like my mind says or even worse and no matter what, I’m inherently evil for wanting things. I feel so much guilt and pressure to be ethical, and I do boycott several brands, but I feel like it’ll never be enough. 

I also want to clarify that I don’t want to justify spending money on questionable/unethical brands/companies. I’d much rather wear literal rags than buy and wear brand-new clothes knowing that the person/people that made my clothes are being abused just so I can have something to wear. But yeah. Every single thing I own or have ever owned probably cost human suffering. This makes me feel so horrible.

no matter how good he is to me, no matter how many times he tells me hes in this for the long run with me and talks about children with me, no matter how much he tells me he loves me, i cant help but to feel like he doesn’t. i feel such overwhelming guilt for it every day. i cry myself to sleep thinking about how much he doesn’t love me but that’s just not true. it makes me feel even worse that i know its not true. it makes me feel so guilty and angry at myself that i can’t accept this love and it feels like i am destroying the best thing thats ever happened to me. it feels like this thing in my head i can’t control is out to get me and is trying to make me leave everything that makes me happy behind. i try so hard, every single day, every single hour, every single passing minute to be healthy. i don’t tell him any of this because really, what is there to say? i don’t want to exhaust him with my own self pity and depression and insecurities. i get angry and jealous of people he spends his time with over me but i just isolate myself and try my best to not let it affect me and hurt him in the crossfire of my irrational and turbulent emotions (which is very very hard in this studio apartment). but it hurts so fucking much. i wish every single day i didn’t have to fight this constant battle in my head. i wish i didn’t have to fight to convince myself that he really does love me even though ALL THE EVIDENCE IS FUCKING THERE. im so sick and tired of myself. im currently in search of therapy and psychiatry and maybe when i finally get it, it will be easier, but i am getting so exhausted. im so exhausted of talking myself off the ledge every single day over the simple fact that my brain cannot accept or comprehend that he loves me. i am so exhausted of stopping myself from killing myself on my way to work because he chose to spend time with his friends over me and now “maybe his friends make him happier than i do, maybe i will never make him happy like that.”my biggest fucking fear in the world is making someone else feel responsible for my own mental illness. i never want to tell him any of this, even though he is so supportive and TELLS me to tell him when im feeling insecure. but i don’t think he understands: its ALL the time. i am insecure and self hating and self pitying ALL the FUCKING time. it gets SO bad in my head. i keep it all inside and that isn’t healthy i know but i cannot stand making him feel bad for me or the thought of hurting him because he might feel like all that he does for me is not enough because thats not true. its more than enough. for someone normal it would be more than enough. i am thinking of ending things because i am so unwell and he doesn’t deserve that. he deserves someone who can feel his love and be happy with it. as i write this at 5 am he is dead asleep and still reaching to scratch my head and missed and scratched my neck and i am bawling my eyes out. i love him so fucking much, i don’t deserve him. i never want to lose him, but i am so sick and tired of myself being scared of everything that might take him away from me even temporarily.

My ex, I will call him J, and I were together for 10 years. I am 33 and he is 34. We met young, I was 20 and he was 21, built basically our entire adult lives together. We lived in his family home, had two dogs together that felt like our kids, and at one point we were engaged with a date set for April 2023.

From the outside, J looks like a catch. He is smart, has a bunch of cars that he restores, is very loyal, very routine, very solid. He helped me get my driver’s license back after a DUI, helped me save money when I lost everything, kept my money safe from my dad when I was trying to buy a car, and even found and maintained that car for me. My dad tried many times to take the money and J refused even after I begged him. My dad found a way around it I got my own car. J fixed everything, planned everything, handled bills, and honestly kept my life from falling apart more times than I can count.

The problem is that somewhere along the way, I stopped feeling like a partner and started feeling like a dependent or a project. Everything in our life revolved around his plans, his cars, his schedule. If we traveled, he planned it. If anything broke, he handled it. If I had feelings about something, it turned into a long “talk” about how I was not communicating right or was being emotional. I felt like I had no power over my own life. I wanted to be more spontaneous and he was more of the planning type. 

I will admit I have not been perfect either. In 2016 I messed up badly. I reconnected with an ex and met him secretly at Dave and Busters. We took photos in the booth and things crossed the line. J found out because my brother told him and he also saw the pictures on my phone. It exploded. He came to my work and caused a scene and the police were called. I felt humiliated and terrified. In the end I begged him to take me back, promised it would never happen again, and we stayed together. I tried to just bury that and move on, but I know it damaged his trust a lot. It took me years to get him to trust me again. 

Even before and after that, I tended to get validation from other men when J and I were not doing well. I would talk to guys from work or the gym, or keep in touch with old flings too long, not physically cheating but venting and flirting to feel wanted. J didn’t trust me and demanded to share locations on our phones. When J found bits of me talking with other guys, he saw it as triangulating and betrayal. I saw it as just talking, but looking back I can see how it felt like there were always other men in the background. I got mad every time he would bring it up and told him i would never cheat because I never wanted to go through the painful reconciliation process ever again. Everyone knew I cheated and I hated it. 

I started to get irritated because we still lived at his parents house and I wanted us to move out and start our own family. He refused and said that our finances didn’t allow for it. Eventually in 2021, he took me on a trip up the California coast and proposed to me over the cliffs at point Lobos. He got me a beautiful ring, and I was really excited and showed everyone. I loved how people would notice it and ask about it. He told me he saw a future with me and wanted to have kids together and start a family, even if we didn’t have our own house yet. 

In 2022, for our 10 year anniversary, we went to Cancun and stayed at a really nice resort. It was supposed to be our big reset. On the last night I made friends with one of the bartenders and he got me extremely drunk. J took me back to the hotel room to sleep where we got into an argument and I completely lost control. I tried to get away from him, was screaming for help in Spanish, and at one point I actually punched him in the face. J FaceTimed my friends to get me to stop. He filmed some of it and later showed me the video. I honestly barely remembered it. Watching myself like that was horrible. He insisted I watch the videos annd I really didn’t like that. After that, he told me he could not go through with the wedding and cancelled it. That broke something in me. Instead of feeling like we would work through it, I felt like he had decided I was broken and unsafe. 

Around this time I started confiding more in my friends. One of my oldest friends, E, lived in the Bay Area and had just left her husband and said she had never been happier. She kept telling me that life was too short to stay with someone if you were not completely in love, that responsibility and being taken care of was not enough, that I deserved passion and fun, and that J was holding me back. She would tell me stories about how her husband was stable but not the right match and it was like she was describing my life. She also talked a lot about not letting a man control you financially or emotionally. I went to visit her and we ended up hanging out at her place the whole time because she had a major conflict with her ex and who was supposed to take care of their son that weekend. 

Soon after I found myself not wanting to go home after work. I started going to the gym more often and I would stay really late. J started questioning me, so I started a fight about how he was too controlling and I stopped sharing my location with him. I stopped wearing the engagement ring and told him it was because it was too big and uncomfortable. That’s about the time that I met C at the gym. He was fit, attractive, and gave me lots of nice attention that made me feel really good. He was 18 then. I know how that sounds. I did not go after him because of his age, it just kind of happened. He was confident, outgoing, playful, and he made me feel young and seen. We would text, hang out at the gym til 2am, then hang out at the beach, go for drives, all the things I had secretly wanted to do but did not feel like I got with J anymore. It started as emotional cheating. I told myself it was harmless. It obviously was not.

Eventually it turned physical. J is very observant and tech savvy and started noticing things. He saw changes in my Instagram, that I deleted pictures of us and only left these free and adventurous looking posts. He asked questions, I lied and said I was out hiking with girlfriends when I was at the beach with C. This plus the ring sitting in the medicine cabinet, he put the pieces together and confronted me. That was August 2023. I denied it, but he swiped my phone out out of my hands and locked himself in the bathroom.

That’s when the shit hit the fan. He went through my phone, saw the deleted messages with C, and everything came out. He called C using my phone and asked if we had been cheating behind his back. C admitted it and J called me a liar and a cheater and said I had done the same thing in 2016 and never really changed. He said I had ruined our trust forever and destroyed our relationship. He told me he was going to call my family, my coworkers, everyone, and tell them what I had done. I felt cornered and ashamed. I lashed out and told him I did not love him anymore and that the love had faded years ago and I was just hoping he would change. I do not even know if that is fully true or if I said it because I needed to justify leaving. 

I moved out that same day and went straight to C’s parents house. I stayed the night there, we had sex, and the next day I went to go find a room to rent. I got my number changed. J did call everyone like he said. He told my relatives, my coworkers, even family in Mexico. I felt like my entire life had been put on blast and his side was the only one people heard. I clung harder to C at that point because I felt like I had burned every other bridge.

After some months of back and forth, I convinced J that C was out of the picture, until J finally said in March 2024 that he wanted the truth about me and all the guys I had been talking to during our relationship. He said he knew I was cheating more than just the times he found out and I just froze and denied it. Deep down I knew he was right but I was not going to admit what he didn’t know despite his hunches or suspicions. I had hooked up with a few guys that he didn’t know about, a handful of one night stands, and I hooked up with one of his car friends when we were at an event in Vegas. I admitted I had been a terrible girlfriend, but I did not admit to the cheating he didn’t already have proof of. He said he didn’t believe me anyway, called me a cradle robber, and said he never wanted to speak to me ever again. He blocked me and told me it was permanent. He kept the dogs told me I would never see them again. That really hurt but I also knew I had no right to argue. 

That same day, things escalated in a really awful way. I had told C some things I felt about J, like being scared of his temper or how intense he can be. I told C that J was abusive and used to hit his mother, but I was making it up and was just mad and riled up. C somehow got it in his head that J might go after his younger brother. There was also something about J knowing where they lived. C is a black belt in taekwondo and showed up at J’s house wanting to fight, but J somehow calmed him down and they talked. J showed him our text messages and pictures that we had sent since the breakup, and it look like I had twisted things or exaggerated to make J look dangerous. J also showed him the pictures of me cheating in 2016 which was weird to me that he still had the pictures. He also showed C the video of me punching J in the face in Cancun. C was so mad, he called me and I admitted I lied about still keeping in touch with J since the breakup. C ended up apologizing to J and walked away feeling like he had been lied to by me. C drove down to the end of the street to pick me up where I was waiting at the park and J drove down the street in his truck and saw as I was getting into C’s car. It was humiliating and made me look manipulative and crazy.

I had no contact with J after that mess. Then, earlier this year, my mom saw a post on Facebook that J’s father had passed away. I lived in that house for ten years. His dad was basically my family too. I felt crushed. I called J several times but he has my number blocked and never picked up. One of his dad’s best friends came into where I work by coincidence and I brought J up, hoping the friend would maybe mention that I wanted to reach out. Then I decided to buy flowers and go to the house in person.

The house looked so different. Everything was repainted. There was a new camera doorbell and everything. When J opened the door, he was ice cold. He said “Can I help you” like I was a stranger. The dogs came to the door and they stopped as soon as he told them, and I felt like a stranger to them. I tried to hand him the flowers and say I was there because of his dad. He immediately brought up the incident with C coming to his house and asked if I had anything to say for myself. I just froze. I felt put on the spot and ashamed and I could not get any words out besides repeating that I was there for his father. He took the flowers but made it clear he did not want me there and that the last time I had been around I had sent my boyfriend to attack him. I left and he has kept no contact since.

Now it has been over two years since the breakup. He seems to be doing fine, working on his cars, traveling, he got the house after his dad died, and is building his life. He isn’t in a relationship yet as far as that I can tell. I am still with C but it is nothing like the fantasy I had in my head. We argue, he is young and does not really understand responsibility, and I find myself missing the life I had with J, even though I also remember feeling controlled and suffocated. I still drive the car that J got me and even though it’s getting pretty old, I don’t ever plan to get rid of it. I see a lot of cars on the road that reminded me of J. C’s parents are divorced, but they are well off and they make sure he is taken care of financially, so even though he can be immature, I do get some kind of solace knowing we have a lot of cushion or help if we need it, but I’m still stuck working 2 jobs, paying off debt that I racked up behind J’s back.  

Sometimes I look back at everything, including the 2016 cheating with my ex, the flirting and cheating with other men when I felt neglected, the Cancun incident where I got so drunk I punched J and he cancelled the wedding, how I hid loans from him. and then the whole situation with C and the confrontation at J’s house, and I feel like I am the worst person alive. Other times I tell myself I was just unhappy and did what I had to do to get out of something that was slowly killing me emotionally. 

So now I do not know what to think or what to do from here. I can’t get it off my mind. I came here to vent because I don’t feel like I can tell any of my friends because I’ve spent so long sticking to a version of the story that makes me look like a victim instead of a villain. I’ve lost a few friends over this already and even quit one of my jobs because I kept getting made fun of by my coworkers every time a young guy would walk in.

Hello. I've (21m) been wanting to write this post for some time, simply to express some of my frustrations to someone, even if it is just to random people on the internet.

About a year and a half ago I made the worst mistake of my life. I got behind the wheel of my car, knowing I had probably had one drink too many. The time leading up to the incident had been the worst period of my life. I was miserable. I felt very alone. I hated myself, my looks, my personality, you name it. It had been about a year since I finished school, and I was just spiraling. Even though on the outside, it might've looked like my life was great. I had an amazing job for a very young age (19 at the time). I had a very nice car, I was financially stable, everything was great. Except it just wasn't.

I, to this day, still don't know for sure why I was so down for so many months. One thing I do know is that I was likely very overworked. I was working about 50-60 hours a week, with an additional 10-12 hours driving to and from work. I was working a (high level for my age) management position for a big retail company in my country. Actually, I was working two management positions, since my supervisor was on maternity leave. This meant I handled the duties of 2 management positions, managing about 20 people at an age of 19-20. I am only writing about my work, because I simply do not know the reason for my misery at the time. I will say I was a little heartbroken at the time, but nothing I felt I couldn't handle. And as I mentioned, a lot of things were going ""well"" in my life. I know all this doesn't excuse my mistake, but this is the only logical explanation I have. I was drinking quite a lot at the time, I guess to escape from reality.

But then came that one night. I had been drinking, and I made the horrible decision to drive my car. Luckily, no one was hurt. I was parking my car when the police pulled me over. They had me blow into a breathalyzer, and then took me to the hospital to get a blood test, then to the police station. I was a mess. At least in my mind. I was pretty much dead on the outside, but my brain was screaming in disappointment. Somehow, the night it happened, my mom knew. I came home very tired, very defeated. She asked me: ""Is something wrong? Did something happen?"". She clearly knows me well. If nothing was wrong (or not wrong enough that I would wanna talk about it), I would've answered immediately, however, of course I would have to tell her about this. Before I could even speak, she asked: ""Did you drive? Did you get pulled over drunk?"". I have no idea how she knew. She didn't react well of course, but she also didn't scold me either. I guess she could tell I knew how stupid it was. Two months later, I got mail from the police, stating my BAC was just over the legal limit. In my country (for good reason) the laws on driving under the influence are quite strict. I had 14 days left to drive, before I would be banned from driving for 3 years. I also had to pay a fine of about 3000€. I was devastated. From the day it happened, I didn't eat, didn't sleep, didn't talk to my friends. The only reason I saw my friends for the two months waiting time was because one of my close friends was graduating. To this day, not even all of my family knows about it. I am simply too ashamed to tell them, and I know my grandma would kill me if she found out. I had to quit my job and find something else. Had to sell the car (which my parents were willing to buy, bless them). My entire life was pretty much crumbling before my eyes. Yet my parents were quick to help me. Figure out ways to make it work. I had given up on everything the day I received that letter. I was ready to end it. I felt like I lost everything with my drivers license. I lost my faith, masculinity, everything I had worked for. Although after about 4 weeks of feeling sorry for myself. I got back to work, and I was starting to get better. Somehow picking myself up, and trying to come to terms with my life.

This was the worst decision of my life. I am not the criminal type. I come from a good family, a good upbringing, and I have no one else to blame but myself. I live with this decision now. The thing I struggle with the most is the shame and the guilt. I will tell myself I deserve to feel this way, and I am constantly waiting for people to tell me this as well. However, somehow, this never happens. My closest friends laugh about it and make jokes (in good spirit, I am good with it). I was prepared to lose friends, because I thought people would think much worse about me. However, people are suspiciously nice about it. This is what I struggle with. I tell myself when I'm cycling to work in the pouring rain, that I deserve this. I did this to myself. I am pretty much the only person to shame myself over this, and I don't understand. 

When I lost my drivers license, I lost a lot of my confidence. Dating was completely off the table. I felt, and still feel, completely emasculated. Which I feel is stupid, but I feel it anyway. I am unable to take anyone on dates, pick people up, make plans etc. However, my experience with dating (since it kind of just happened inevitably), feels so weird. The girls I have dated have been good with it. They have even respected me for telling them (Thank you Cecilia). And I simply don't understand. In my eyes, my worth as a partner is lower because of my inability to drive, and also the fact that I have made that kind of mistake. Also, I am not just so hot that whatever crime I could have committed, doesn't even matter. I am an average dude. Even the girl I am dating now seems to have no problem with it, stating that I am not a burden at all, even when I feel like it because she has to drive us everywhere. I dread having to make plans with her, because I cannot take her anywhere. She has to drive. I have even sometimes insisted taking the bus or cycling to dates, even in the very cold winter. She calls me an idiot for it, insisting on picking me up, and I end up insisting to pay for gas and ""burdenmoney"". I feel like I can't be a proper boyfriend, and it is boring a hole in my brain, to the point where I am considering ending it, simply for this reason. Her parents also don't know, and they have apparently been asking her why I'm not picking her up, since somehow they know I used to drive. I don't know how I would go about telling them, and I am deathly afraid of telling them. Who would want their daughter to date some idiot who got a DUI?

I don't understand. I feel so much shame and guilt all the time. I dread having to tell people, yet their reaction is always surprisingly positive. Even when I told my old boss, he simply felt sorry for me, even making plans for how we would make it work with the bus times. It was just too far to make it work every day. I have felt for some time, that I would not be able to start life properly again, until I got my drivers license back. I have tried my best. Making it work where I can, but sometimes, it really fucking sucks. I have some days where I am very mean to myself because of it, but I do try to avoid this. Therapy isn't really an option for me, simply because in my country, it is very expensive and there is a waitlist of 2-3 years anyway. I don't know what I wanted with this post. It just feels good to get it out of my system I guess. I still walk around with shame every day, but I guess it does become a routine to just get on the bike every day instead. I feel like it is something I live with. Not something that gets better day by day. I am simply waiting for the 3 years to be up.",1764017159.0,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1p5sna8/feelings_of_extreme_shame_and_guilt_after_a_dui/,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1p5sna8/feelings_of_extreme_shame_and_guilt_after_a_dui/,,True,"idiot, kill, stupid",0.18,self_directed,"violence_type=self_directed; violence type: self_directed; example windows: my grandma would kill me if she; violent_hits=1; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0; self-directed wording (e.g. 'kill me') – not a call to harm others, but still potentially concerning.",False,,False

1pdc1a7,TrueOffMyChest,they are animals OR vermin OR subhuman OR cockroaches OR parasites,luckiest-,My bf gave my autistic son the best birthday ever,"
I 25f am a single mom to Lewis (fake name) who just had his 6th birthday. My son also happens to be on the autism spectrum, he’s high functioning but is still trying to navigate his everyday life with some difficulties. He has sensory issues, special interests, and he gets overstimulated in really crowded places. However he’s been slowly navigating his life and has been doing so much better as he gets older. 

Now that you have some background about him I want to tell you about my boyfriend Jordan (fake name). He’s a heavy machinery mechanic who focuses mostly on farming equipment but will also help out some construction businesses if they’re in a pinch and don’t have a person for that already. Jordan owns his own business which he runs out of his own house and garage. He lives on a big plot of land in the rural areas. He keeps livestock like chickens, ducks, goats, and cows but he doesn’t farm them out. I personally don’t understand how he has the time to do everything he does with us and work but he’s amazing. Lewis instantly took a liking to Jordan and vice versa. Lewis loves visiting the “farm” as he calls it and riding around with Jordan in his UTV. Lewis is super interested in building Lego and just working with his hands, he loves to follow Jordan in the garage and learn about cars, engines, tractors, bailors, etc. Jordan has been an absolute god send for Lewis, he’s so careful with him, he even buys packs of gloves so Lewis doesn’t need to worry as much about the sensory overload with grease and whatever else they come into the house covered in. 

Moving to this last month Jordan told me he wanted to give Lewis the best possible birthday he could! I kind of brushed it off as he’ll get him a small gifts like one of the cheap Lego sets or toy tractors. NOPE! He walked us to the big garage and opened the door. This man went out of his way to get Lewis every single thing he could think of. He got Lewis 10 LEGO sets and built him a freaking go kart. This man spent well over $1,000 on my son. I know he makes a lot of money but my jaw hit the floor! I instantly just dropped to the floor sobbing. I never ever expected anybody to be so caring about a little boy they didn’t have to do anything for. Lewis was overjoyed, the first thing he did was yell “is that a go kart!? Can I ride in it with you Jordan? Wait are those Lego sets? You got me the titanic set? I wanted that forever!” The look on Lewis’s face was enough to last me a lifetime of happiness. Jordan did what nobody else has done for us without even asking! The look on Jordan’s face was just pure excitement to see Lewis so happy. Of course he told Lewis that the go kart was his and that he can drive it as long as one of us sits with him until he learns how to drive it better. I’m sorry for all the rambling and maybe some of it was not coherent but thank you to anyone who read this.

1pd8mr2,TrueOffMyChest,they are animals OR vermin OR subhuman OR cockroaches OR parasites,Additional_Use_7900,"Unexplained vision of burning tower block in the Somerset (UK) countryside on a drive home, in a spot where no tower exists","It’s taken a very long time to even consider posting this anywhere as it could be seen as a little insensitive, but I am genuinely posting this today because I want to try and understand what I saw. I am not pushing any supernatural angle or claiming anything dramatic. I just want to maybe one day find a logical explanation for something that has stayed with me for years.

This happened in early summer 2017 on a Tuesday evening. I was driving home towards Frome (UK) from Shepton Mallet and the light was just starting to move into that early sunset stage. It was still bright with clear visibility.

As I came around a bend in the road, something up ahead caught my eye straight away. It made me stop and pay full attention.

In the distance, towering above the horizon/treeline, I saw what looked exactly like a tall, dark tower block with rows of glowing orange squares. They flickered like fire. The outline was sharp and rectangular. It looked structured and nothing like a cloud or a reflection.

My first feeling was a little panic, as to be honest what I was seeing was clearly a tower block of flats on fire, there was no other way to describe what it was. I slowed down and tried to work out where it was and if I needed to turn around or anything. Within a few seconds I remembered that there are no tall buildings of any kind anywhere around that area. Certainly nothing that resembled the size or shape of what I was looking at. Once that sank in the initial panic faded and turned into confusion.

I kept driving and the same shape kept appearing through gaps in the trees. Every time I saw it, it looked identical. A tall black silhouette with glowing orange windows, it was a burning building. It stayed in the same place on the horizon and did not seem to come any closer or move further away, even after seeing it on and off over about 3 miles of driving.

I tried to follow the direction of it so I could get a clear view. I thought if I could just get an open stretch of road I would finally understand what it was. But when I reached the point where I should have had the clearest view, it had vanished. Not faded or changed shape. It was simply gone.

When I got home that night I searched online for any reports of a fire. I checked Twitter for personal sightings, news sites, anything local. There was nothing at all. No smoke. No flames. No emergency activity.

So I went to bed without an answer.

The next morning the television was already on. The first thing I saw when I woke up was the news coverage of the Grenfell Tower fire in London. It was the first thing I had seen since the night before that visually matched what I had been trying to make sense of. The dark tower. The orange glowing window shapes. The flickering light. It was exactly what I saw towering in front of me the night before.

I want to be clear that I am not saying I saw Grenfell or anything connected to it. The timings do not match as what I saw was about 4 hours before the fire in London started. I am only explaining why the experience stayed in my mind and why I kept thinking about it afterwards.

It was difficult speaking to people at work the next day, as the news of the Grenfell fire was breaking. People wondered if I had misinterpreted something or if it could have been a trick of the light. They even questioned whether it might have been a hallucination. I doubted my own memory many times.

The thing that stops me from dismissing it is the simple fact that I was not alone. My partner was with me the entire time. They saw the exact same thing. They reacted at the same moment. They described the burning building. We spoke about it as it was happening and our memories line up perfectly today.

So whatever it was, it was not just in my head.

I am posting this because I would genuinely like someone to explain what might cause something like this. A rational explanation would actually be a relief after so many years of wondering.

I would also love to know if anyone else happened to be on that same stretch of road that evening, although I realise the chances are very slim. This was on the A361, heading towards Frome from Shepton Mallet, on the hill/dual carriageway leading up to the Nunney Catch roundabout.

Has anyone else ever had a shared visual experience with their partner that made no sense at the time and remains unexplained even years later?

Any thoughts would be appreciated.",1764778819.0,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pd8mr2/unexplained_vision_of_burning_tower_block_in_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pd8mr2/unexplained_vision_of_burning_tower_block_in_the/,,False,,0.0,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0,False,,False

Tl:Dr: we matched on Bumble and he was super eager to see me. I made it clear I wouldn’t sleep with him and he agreed and said he just knows what he wants when he sees it so we met and hung out. For reference on why I’m so triggered it’s because it’s a pattern of men realizing I’m great or whatever but they always end up showing they aren’t capable of being there for me correctly. 

I’m educated, have a stable career, have a nice apartment car style etc my family is stable as in they are still together.
Many men I’ve been meeting don’t have the family stability or stability in their life period even if they make money I’ve noticed. A guy I met very recently couldn’t stop complimenting me saying I’m perfect have a great personality etc then he drops the bomb he’s fresh out a traumatic breakup and can’t date right now but wants friends?? But sort of blamed me for being tempting explaining why he left suddenly when he slept over my place. Because he was tempted by me however he knew that??
I’m very much confused on what to do. I want love and romance, I cut him off because I can’t have a man around who isn’t bringing that and has emotional baggage.
Advice??? 
Also his reply to my message saying I need romance to continue was have a great day beautiful with a heart. I’m so confused.

1pddli2,AmItheAsshole,kill OR murder OR shooting OR stabbed OR bomb attack OR violent attack,Loud-Mouthbreathing,AITA; roommate upset with me about my alarm,"I live in a small college dorm with one other person. My roommate doesn’t get up in the morning (or go to class) and sleeps until about noon. I get up at 6:30 am on Tuesday and Thursday, 7:30 Wednesday and Friday, and sleep at home the rest of the week.

My roommate is a complainer and has bitched about the alarm before. I’ve tried to compromise and have tried multiple different alarm sounds  and they still are upset about the alarm. 

I’d kind of just given up and decided to use the alarm and let them be pissy. But the reason I’m posting this is because I kind of feel like a dick. I was sleeping very heavily this morning and didn’t wake up to the alarm right away, I think it was going off for 30-40 seconds (alarm goes off at 7:30, clock still said 7:30 when I got up) and when I when I did get up my roommate was glaring at me. I’m normally a light sleeper and wake up very quickly to any sudden noise (gotta love trama) so sleeping through my alarm for even a few seconds is very unusual for me. 

I’ve tried my best to be considerate with this roommate, but they don’t grant me the same kindness (they don’t shower, let food rot in the room, wake me up regularly, intentionally trigger asthma attacks, etc) I’m sure someone will comment calling me a baby or a whiner, but I don’t want to be an asshole. We only have 2 more weeks (including this one) and I’ve been approved to move out next semester and will be getting out of here as soon as possible.

As much as I want to make this roommates life suck for how much they’ve tortured me, I don’t want to give them any reason to get me in trouble or anything excuse to make my life worse.

Idk what to do. Should I get some ear buds and find a way to make the alarm go through those? Am I even in the wrong here?

1pa7ytu,AmItheAsshole,kill OR murder OR shooting OR stabbed OR bomb attack OR violent attack,casincannabis,AITA for arguing with my grandmother after she cut our dogs claw down too far?,"So I (19M) live with my grandparents, as rent where I live is extremely expensive and I sadly just cannot afford to leave home with the wages I make. To clarify, I am forever incredibly grateful they allow me to stay and would be lost without their generosity. 

Today, me and my grandmother (58F) were grooming our youngest dog. He is a bit skittish and doesn't enjoy getting his nails clipped, but does tolerate it. He has all black nails which makes clipping them a bit more challenging. Because of this, I hold and soothe him as he gets them done. my grandmother gets impatient, which is understandable as its not a very fun chore, and clips them down farther than recommended (they say clip little by little until you see the black dot of the quick, she seems to just guess and cut around twice.) 

I had stopped her once or twice from going down too far on some, which seemed to agitate her a bit, as she is very independent and kept saying ""I know how to do it."" while cutting the last nail, I hadn't noticed how far down she had the clippers. She hit his quick and he yiped pretty bad. Out of instinct I half-yelled ""grandma!"" frustratedly as I checked his claw for bleeding. I felt that because she wanted to just get it over with, she was cutting down without thinking about how far his quick actually was down his nail.

I agree I should not have raised my voice, however as I stated before it was almost instinctual as the dogs are extremely dear to me, having gotten me through major depressive episodes. I didn't mean for it to come out as harsh as it did however and I am extremely apologetic about this aspect. 

she seemed to take this as a personal attack however, despite me not saying anything other than this, and started to yell about disrespect and not tolerating people talking to her like that. though i could tell she felt bad, she claimed it ""wasnt even that bad"" (it was) and it seemed as though she prioritized defending herself over actually helping me look at and comfort the dog. I tried to explain that I understood she didnt mean to hurt him, however she still did and she had to go slower and be more careful. it seemed to go in one ear and out the other as she had already registered my words as disrespect. 

as I got up from helping her apply quick stop, she continued to talk loudly to herself about kids talking to her ""like shit"". that attitude carried into how she talked to everyone the rest of the night which caused the argument to spiral.

I understand that she felt guilty for hurting our dog and absolutely didnt mean to, and I don't hate her for it or anything, I was simply worried and it came out in a bad way. she seems to take most criticism as a personal attack however, even if it genuinely comes from a good place, and its very strenuous on our relationship. 

I agree that I could be also in the wrong, but I do not believe I'm completely the asshole. I would appreciate some fresh sets of eyes to help me see the situation more clearly.

1p8sako,AmItheAsshole,kill OR murder OR shooting OR stabbed OR bomb attack OR violent attack,Disastrous_Rough_756,AITA for ruining Thanksgiving?,"Throwaway account. I (25F) took my bf (20M) with me to thanksgiving dinner last night and it went fine.... well... It was normal at first anyways. I showed up, got ignored, talked over, snapped at, and looks of disdain from my Aunt, Sister and Grandmother. 

Well I left to walk the dog with my grandpa and while i was gone, my aunt, let's call her Vicky, cornered my bf, Tyler, and started asking intrusive and inappropriate questions about my life, my choices and my body and making commentary about my late mother and how she ruined me from having a good relationship with the rest of the family. When I returned to the room and sat down, she immediately began asking question after question about my workout habits. Am I doing my martial arts? Do I go to Planet Fitness. Oh no don't do hot yoga (i don't) because you can get heat stroke. I sat there and held my tongue through that. Then Vicky started commenting on my body saying she wants me to be more fit. 

By then I'd had enough, after *years* of just sitting there and letting them verbally attack me for my decisions and choices and continuing to treat me (and tell Tyler that I am) nothing more than a broken child that needs fixing and medicating, I said ""I appreciate your concern but I don't appreciate commentary on my body at this time"" and the entire room dove into chaos. My Aunt was visibly upset, my sister started yelling, taking her side of course, and Vicky started crying saying that she was just trying to be nice because she doesn't know anything about my life. I told her then she should ask me a question that didn't involve my body. 

The rest of the night was awkward, with my grandpa having to calm down the three women who had gone into separate rooms in tears because i had the gal to talk back and set a boundary. Tyler and I ended up leaving early. 

But here's the thing, my grandma is sick and dying and there's a chance she won't even make it to Christmas, and I feel bad that possibly her last major holiday was spent in argument and disaster.

1p8de8q,AmItheAsshole,kill OR murder OR shooting OR stabbed OR bomb attack OR violent attack,apples_and-bananas,AITA for getting rid of my bfs cat?,"So i (22F) have been dating my boyfriend (23M) for almost 2 years, and for the most part things are great, but the biggest problem is his cat.

His cat hates me. She really hates me. I'm not a cat hater, I love animals, but she hisses when I enter a room, swats when I walk past, and looks stressed if I'm around. I clearly make her unhappy.

When I moved in three months ago, I thought that would be my chance to bond with her. I did so much research, was slow and gentle, tried treats and toys, tried to build a positive routine. Nothing worked. It got worse. She knocks over my cups, only mine, pees on my clothes, I can’t leave anything out. She won’t sleep in our bedroom anymore and instead sits outside the door meowing constantly.

My bf says give her time, but it's been months. I'm miserable in my own home because I can't use half the furniture without being glared at or attacked. I have to keep everything put away, and I barely sleep because of the meowing. There is so much tension in the house because of a cat.

I felt bad for the cat too. She was always upset, and stress is bad for any animal. My bf’s sister has offered before to take the cat because she loves her, has no other pets, and the cat has stayed there before and loved it. I brought it up to my bf but he always refused, saying she was here first. I get he loves his cat but I think he's not doing what's best for her. She’s unhappy.

So I talked to his sister again, and she agreed. While my bf was on a work trip I drove the cat to her place. She updated me that the cat was settling in well and seemed happier.

My bf came home and I told him. He's very upset, which I expected, but I thought he’d realize this is better for the cat. Now he’s refusing to talk to me and says he needs to think about our relationship. I tried to explain how I felt and that this wasn't good for the cat either but he won't listen. In my opinion you have to put the animals well being first. He’s acting like I dumped her on the side of the road. She is happier now and I don’t understand why he can't accept that.

1pdb9d7,AmItheAsshole,they are animals OR vermin OR subhuman OR cockroaches OR parasites,Low_Visual_650,AITA for not visiting my newborn niece and nephew,"I (40 F), my husband (41 M) and two kids (6 &amp; 9) moved a little over 1,000 miles from our home state about 2.5 years ago.   
  
My brother (38 M) and his girlfriend recently had twin babies via IVF. They spent years trying to start a family. I want to support the new parents as best as I can, even considering I live far away. I went to the baby shower over the summer and spent over $1,000 to be there.  
  
Here's some pertinent information. My husband and I make a decent amount of money and my family is aware. We're not millionaires and our new home is a lot more expensive than our previous. I set money aside every month for travel, including the cost to visit the new babies. It will cost me $1,500 to see them, which I do have saved. Also, my brother's girlfriend is kind of an a\*\*hole. Last year she sent me a text telling me that I was a bad daughter to my dad and mom an bad sister to my brothers. The shortened version of her issues with me was that I don't call my dad enough and I didn't reach out to my brothers enough in the months leading up to our move. I apologized for how I made them feel and explained I was dealing with unmedicated post partum depression and anxiety, along with moving out of state at the time, and I was struggling. Lastly, when I had my second baby, and I was living in my home state, maybe 1.25 hours away from my brother and his girlfriend, they didn't travel to us to meet our baby. They met her at a family holiday event when she was 3 months.  
  
To the issue at hand. I told my family I was going to try and visit before the end of the year, but the timing just hasn't worked out. I've never committed to a date, but said ""maybe early December"". Every time I communicate with my brother or his girlfriend they make comments that I need to see the babies before they're too big. My mom told me my brother's girlfriend was complaining that I keep changing the date that I'm going to visit. I've never committed to a date, just given possibly dates when asked.  
  
My take on the matter, I can't believe the audacity of these two. I don't feel they appreciate the time and money it will take for me to travel to them. AITA for not visiting my niece and nephew already? Or, are they being unreasonable with their expectations?  
  
Edit from cross post:  
  
Based on some responses I'd like to provide a bit more context. My family and I get along well. Family events are filled with laughter. Last xmas a different SIL mentioned how she loves our family and she likes getting together with our family more than her own, including me in that. There is no the underlying current of hatred. The only person who I would be less excited to see is my brother's girlfriend (mother of the twins).  
  
I don't feel that I've given definitive date for my travel so until then it's up in the air and should be treated as so. But this is the piece where maybe I'm missing something and not realizing how up in the air dates can be confusing to others.",1764784488.0,26,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pdb9d7/aita_for_not_visiting_my_newborn_niece_and_nephew/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pdb9d7/aita_for_not_visiting_my_newborn_niece_and_nephew/,,False,,0.05,none,violence_type=none; no violent or hate-related terms detected; violent_hits=0; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0; intense tone (many ALL CAPS words),False,,False

Wild video shows the moment a disagreement between a driver and a pedestrian escalated into a full on roadside brawl after tempers boiled over.

The incident occurred around midday on Sunday in the popular beachside Sydney suburb of Coogee.

Bystander Steve said the two men were trading words for a few minutes before coming to blows.

**“The gentleman in the white shirt was crossing the road - it’s pretty busy there on Sundays in Coogee - the guy in the car kind of went before he’d walked across the road and they’ve exchanged words as you would,” he told news.com.au.**

“In other words, he just said, ‘oh, f\*\*k, come on, mate’.”

**Steve said the pedestrian approached the car window, and a passenger emerged from the car and got back in “about two or three times” before the scuffle broke out.**

**“It wasn’t until the guy (in the white shirt) told the lady (in the car) to go f\*\*k herself that old mate lost his s\*\*t,” he said.**

“He just ignited a fuse. He’s come roaring out of the car and chased him. It was mayhem,” Steve continued.

“I don’t think they really wanted to go at each other before that, he just f\*\*\*\*\*g lost his s\*\*t.”

The witness said traffic was held up “a good three to five minutes” before both men went on their way.

“I’d love to see them go toe-to-toe in the ring.

“The dog didn’t leave his side, that’s loyalty. Dogs are loyal, man.”

He went on to say such scenes weren’t uncommon in the area.

“You know what? It does happen there on Sundays because there are a lot of people who come in who don’t really know that you’ve got to give way to the pedestrians there,” he said.

Steve was with two young children at the time of the incident and said he had difficulty explaining the situation to them.

“I mean, there were young kids around there and I got two of my own, they were looking out the window at them, asking ‘why were they doing that?’” he said.

“You know, you’ve got to explain it to them. (One of the kids) wanted to re-enact it. It’s just like ‘no, mate’.”

Steve said he’d had words with the local council to ensure the incident didn’t occur again.

NSW Police said they had no information relating to the incident.

In terms of location, Coogee is not too far away from Bondi Beach, Australia (arguably nicer) and attracts many people to the beach from Sydney - particularly on weekends. It has expensive property prices c.A$4.3m (US$2.8m) for house / c.A$0.94m for unit/apartment).

1pcgue1,changemyview,kill OR murder OR shooting OR stabbed OR bomb attack OR violent attack,throwaway75643219,"CMV: the US in 1945 was the strongest country that has ever existed, or will ever exist, relatively speaking","To be clear, obviously this is relatively speaking -- in absolute terms, the US of today is far stronger than the US of 1945, along with arguably many other modern countries.

Now as far as what I mean by ""strongest"": militarily, economically, societally, etc.

I'll start with the economy of the US of 1940: directly producing \~60% of the world's oil, and controls \~80% when considering South America (the US wouldnt allow Venezuela to sell oil to Germany/the Axis powers for instance). 

By 1945, its market share has dipped ever so slightly -- a couple percent (\~57%) -- but still far and away the largest oil producer in the world, and can control the vast majority of the world's oil supply/where it goes.

By 1945, the US accounts for about a third of the world's GDP, and more than half of all manufactured goods. Highest GDP per capita in the world, richest country in the world.

On top of all of that, by 1945 the US is effectively still untouched by WW2, both in terms of population deaths and destruction of its economic/industrial base, while most of Europe/Asia has been destroyed/decimated to varying degrees.

Geographically speaking, the US is probably the most geographically blessed country in history -- straddles two major oceans and has massive internal river networks for navigation by water, which also makes it virtually unassailable by invasion. Has the world's largest area of arable farmland, 4th largest population (at the time) and 3rd largest land area overall, but the largest area of climate-suitable land for dense human population of any country ever.

Technologically speaking, the US is at the forefront of basically every area of science/technology, and in some fields is far ahead. Has the world's greatest education system, both public and private.

Among the world's healthiest/longest lived at the time, most literate, highest standard of living. American culture was spreading across the world via radio/movies/music/businesses.

Militarily speaking, the US of 1945 is likely the strongest military to have ever existed/will ever exist in relative terms. Nearly three quarters of the world's naval tonnage. Half the world's airplane manufacturing. Has more than 100 aircraft carriers, two thirds of the world total. More than half the world's submarines. As mentioned previously, control over the vast majority of the world's oil, but also the majority of the world's gasoline refining capacity, and it could simply cut off any other country's navy/airforce if it chose to, and/or bomb any other oil fields in the world, while no other country could do the same to it. Only the UK had the ships capable of attacking the US or the US oil fields, but the UK had no oil production of its own, and so was utterly reliant on the US for its own oil.

And lastly, of course, the ace up its sleeve: it has nuclear weapons, which no other country has, and it has the ability to deliver nuclear weapons anywhere on Earth.

As things become more competitive/equal in the future, I just dont see any country in the future having that sort of global dominance, nor does any country/empire of the past. The US is really the first (and to this day, still the only) country capable of putting millions of men, and all their equipment/supplies, on a completely different continent, thousands of miles away. I just dont think its comparable when an empire like Rome, say, literally couldnt have influenced or done anything about China, even if it wanted to. 

The only empire that really compares in my mind is possibly the British Empire at its height, but I still feel like its not really close -- the control of the majority of the world's oil that allows for unprecedented power projection, along with being the only country with nuclear weapons at the time, just sets the US in 1945 in a class of its own.

The Roman Empire, British Empire, Chinese empire, and the Mongol empire are the only ones that I think would really even be in the running.",1764701375.0,940,414,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1pcgue1/cmv_the_us_in_1945_was_the_strongest_country_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1pcgue1/cmv_the_us_in_1945_was_the_strongest_country_that/,,True,bomb,0.08,descriptive,"violence_type=descriptive; violence type: descriptive; example windows: to and or bomb any other oil; violent_hits=1; hate_hits_strong=0; hate_hits_generic=0; violent words appear in descriptive context, not as a call to action.",False,,False
1pbtfm1,changemyview,kill OR murder OR shooting OR stabbed OR bomb attack OR violent attack,dertypdahalt,CMV: China will not attack Taiwan in the foreseeable future,"By foreseeable future I mean the next 5 to 10 years. After that its anyone's guess. Lets get to my reasons:

1. Age -&gt; China's average age is about 40 right now with a huge segment of whats basically ""Chinese boomers"" going into retirement soon. They don't have the numbers of ""disposable"" young men to just throw away in some war. Add to this the wave of emigration and brain drain that would follow and a war of aggression would seriously harm their economy and with that regime security.
2. Taiwan's position -&gt; ""position"" I mean in two ways here. They see how much Russia struggles with invading a country that's basically a flat plane, just how much harder would it be to invade an island then? ""position"" is also a relevant term politically. Taiwan would be supported by multiple western powers, just like Ukraine.
3. Trade -&gt; China is heavily dependent on naval trade to get its export goods abroad and getting the oil they have to import. With the US as the worlds #1 naval power both of this would suddenly become impossible, essentially collapsing their economy and with that probably the rule of the CCP.
4. Siberia -&gt; Even if China was to wager a war of aggression, Siberia would just be the easier and more rewarding goal. The ""mighty"" Russian army struggles to win their ""three day special military operation"" and is stuck on the other side of the continent while also looking like a bunch of incompetent buffoons. Russia looks submissive and invadeable. Add to that this does not require a naval crossing. Add to that this would not lead to western sanctions or the west cutting their naval trade. Add to that Siberia (unlike Taiwan) has plenty of the oil China needs.

All in all they'd be really stupid to attack Taiwan, but Siberia might be on the chopping block.



*EDIT: Regarding russian nukes:*

1pashxr,changemyview,kill OR murder OR shooting OR stabbed OR bomb attack OR violent attack,Shadowblade83,CMV: Immigration is the largest threat to  the West.,"
Europe is not what it was. Nor is the USA, for that matter. Go back to the 80s: both were powerful, their citizens were generally well off, a family could afford a house easily, the national identity strong. Not without exeptions, but far from the problems of today.

Today Europe is divided between a rising far-right, and old school political parties that even combined has a harder time stopping them. The only reasons for the rise is the established parties refusal to tacle sustainable immigration. Some are not even to the traditional right at all, but socialist or centrist with an anti-immigration policy; but the media portray them as alt-right all the same. Society is more divided then it has ever been since WW2. Standing toe-to-toe with Islamists we now find the far left. They hate our own culture and economy enough to side with whomever are at odds with it. An unholy alliance.

Somewhere along the way, one found it humanitarian to let in a lot of people that do not share the culture that made the West what it is, and who *had no plans to fully integrate*. For decades they and media allies repeated the lies; this migration was beneficially economically, and culturally. Instead, simple truths are evident: Import the thirld world…become the thirld world. Islamists are the worst, and perhaps main reason why it turned out so bas. «No stronger retrograde force exists in the world» as Churchill said. 

Economically, it is an unmitigated disaster. Many European countries have lost untold billions doling out welfare, having more expensive security messures, and increased health care costs. We can no longer give out citizens enough, fund our own security. We have, relatively, less of bright minds with the right attitude that helped us succeed in the past. But: some have benefited. Both in Europe, and in the US, mass migration has seen to that wages have stayed lower then they otherwise would have. Some infividuals have made billions supplying places to live, legal addice etc.

Culturally, it is no longer safe to speak you mind om certain religions or practices. lest you get shunned, attacked, or even killed. 
Some areas withing Europe are no-go zones for police etc. Many areas are unsafe. Everyone will by now have walked somewhere in Europe that could have been the slums of Egypt. Women can no longer feel to safe in certain areas, and forget displaying your love for soneone of the same sex.
Sweden, once a peaceful nation, soon have more gang-realated deaths per capita then the US. (And they don’t even face real jail time, or hard jail conditions…more like hotels, or part-time jails where they get weekend leaves) 
Paradoxically, mainly driven by the need to avert terror incidents from islsmists, the governments will ever more try to decrease citizen privacy protection. Therefore chat controls, and police knocking on you door because of sicial media.

Demographically, Europe is dying. No wonder, when people have to study and work so hard to pay the increased taxes to pay for this debacle. Europeans have less kids because it’s hard to do when you are overworked, under-paid, and over-taxed. Yet, if your cultural heritage has less of work ethic or the culture makes the fenmale stay at home…an European western welfare state will pay you well for not contributing. More if you have a bunch of oppspring. That are likely to carry  culture on. Ghadaffi once said «Islam will not conquer Europe with an army, but with baby-strollers»

Economic decline, fractious societies, rising crime, increaed taxations…the strange death of Europe (save eastern states that said no to immigration): it can be laid at the altar of immigration, most of the from MENA countries. 

And if the saving grace is that it is not that bad in 2025…chech the demographic math for 2050. Europe as we know it will be history…

1pdc3l5,changemyview,they are animals OR vermin OR subhuman OR cockroaches OR parasites,CompetitiveAd9639,CMV: Religion is a Critical element of a functional Society that has not been adequately replaced.,"I apologize this was written very stream of consciousness and I am not sure where I land on religion, I would say I am agnostic at the moment. But I was raised in a religious home and saw a lot of the positives that come with it. This may have biased me a bit, as I know there are significant issues that come with it, but in my opinion, the belief systems associated with most major religions have been a major point of cohesion and moral structure depended upon by most if not all “successful” societies. Its removal without a suitable substitute will result in fractured trust and a slow degradation of our society.

Even with all its flaws, religion might be a necessary ingredient for a stable, cooperative society, and our rapid abandonment of it has created a dangerous vacuum. Again, I’m not arguing that religion is perfect or that it hasn’t caused serious harm. It absolutely has, from institutional abuses to oppressive dogmas to power structures that were exploited by elites. But when I look historically at the societies that built strong communities, high trust, and long-term cooperation, it seems like a deeply religious majority played a critical role. Religious frameworks often motivate, or at least preach the need for altruism, honesty, service, and self-restraint in ways that secular systems haven’t been able to replicate at scale. People genuinely believed someone was “watching,” which pushed them to act ethically even when no one else was around. It also reduced the kind of endless pursuit of wealth and consumption that seems to dominate today. I would have to agree that a glaring caveat to this is the mega church pastors that promote tieths and knowingly steal from their congregation, but this circles back to the knowledge that religion is not perfect and there will always be people that take advantage for their own personal gain. I also think that they can’t possibly be true believers and act this way, as if they followed the teachings of literally any religion, what they are doing violates everything they claim to espouse. 

But my eye is less drawn toward the elites, because they tend to be morally bankrupt monsters in any age, but I feel where it matters more is at the level of the average person. What worries me the most is that we’ve had a mass exodus from religion without building any functional replacement for it. We have consistently seen that people will fill that void with something, could be a positive focus on community, family, etc. but more often it is filled with hyper-individualism, political identity, consumerism, or nihilism, none of which seems capable of producing the trust and cooperation a society needs to function. This is not as big a deal if the population living this way is small, or the society itself is relatively small and less complex, but as a society grows the need for cooperation and trust, the more this becomes an issue. I feel like we are just starting to move into a world where a large section of the modern population has turned away from religion, but it was done within the generation, so gen z and alpha and millenials to some extent will be the large grouping that is not only not religious but may not have even been raised in a religious house hold. I feel this will be a very interesting social experiment to watch as it remains to be seen what will happen as further generations grow up with out religious influence at all. Throughout history, every stable civilization had some form of shared transcendent moral framework; religion shaped a common code and gave people a reason to put community needs above personal desires (a trait we have been adapted to prize as social creatures, but this seems to be the case in a much more tribal/small group focus - it becomes more abstract when you get to the size and complexity of modern nations- which is my main point, that religion has helped fill in this gap, helping us establish broader communities with a shared sense of morality and understanding there is something greater than us and that if I follow the rules it will benefit me in the long run). Without that, I believe morality can become more ambiguous, and the loss of that ever present feeling of a benevolent force watching you, there is no immediately recognizable motivation for people to do “what’s right” even if it goes against their own self interest. Unfortunately, as creatures, we hold on to the negative much longer than the positive, so one story of a negative thing happening has an outsized impact on the overall zeitgeist. In the absence of a divine reason to be good, which helps you stay stedfast and act in a moral way even when others are not or no one is around, I think that small change makes it so more people think even just a little more about themselves, and it will become a snowball where trust begins to erode, cooperation collapses, and social fabric frays. 

I think the question of god is a tough one, and any type of religious violence or coercion is awful and recognize it does happen, but I don’t believe the old line that religion is at the base of all war, rather I think it was used as an excuse for very human motivation and ego. Strip that away yes you might have removed the crusades, but in its place would be a market driven war to secure oil rights disguised as a hunt for weapons of mass destruction. I think that people are greedy and religion is a good way to get people to buy into something and serve a “greater good”. But my whole point here is that is not a bad thing in itself, in fact it’s exactly what we need for society to function. Rather it becomes bad when elites bastardize it and use it for their own means, but they can do that just as easily in our modern culture, using money, fear, etc to accomplish the same ends.

Again, I was raised in a religious family and have since strayed. However, giving it more and more thought, Is it possible that religion, for all its faults, was an essential tool for keeping societies cohesive, and that losing it without a replacement is a major contributor to today’s social fragmentation? I think so, but please change my view.

1pdbv4s,changemyview,they are animals OR vermin OR subhuman OR cockroaches OR parasites,naughtyobama,CMV: Regular folks aren't the audience for the AI Boom.,"Here's the roadmap, as best as I understand it:

- Phase 1: General availability of LLMs, mostly in chat format. Its sold as assistants to humans in most cases to increase adoption.

- Phase 2: the agentic age. Heavy focus on long form reasoning and expertise in specific domains like physics, math, coding, medicine, etc. Agents can reason for and against each other to self correct. They still require human input or deterministic workflows for the most part. So automation plus LLMs integration is a popular formula. This is mostly sold as ""let ai deal with the tedious work"". Its also billed as purposeful AI that can boost productivity.  Maybe you can fire 2 developers and still come out ahead of when you had a team of 5.

- Phase 3: breaking through the cyber-physical barrier. Robotics + agents. Bots that do high precision medical surgeries, assembly line work, etc. Then bots that can operate in less predictable environments. This is intended to mimic human thinking and action without explicitly saying so.

- Phase 4: AGI. Human-like intelligence. This is what ALL of these AI companies are working towards. EVERY single one of them. That's a huge part of what's driving the AI  spend IMHO. Massive AI factories with human like intelligence that are constantly solving problems humans can't today through scalability. Whomever owns the data centers that can power these AGI systems own the future, if they can get there before it all crashes down.

Beyond that, they think they can get to ASI (super intelligence beyond human capabilities) if they can get to AGI.


Who's going to keep buying stuff when we have no jobs? Well, we're not sure and neither do they. If they do, theyre sure not telling us! 

But today, they can count on fat government contracts and small, gradual enterprise adoption, prosumer retail licenses and ad optimization from ""free tier"" licensing as well as the vast amount of info they're gathering to continue to train these models on the way to AGI.

I suspect they'll have to pretend to like UBI but we know they'll oppose it. We can't even fund medicaid, obamacare or snap today. 

The alternatives are to change the economic system we use. Won't be the first time we'll do it in human history. But it can't be based on supply and demand by the populace. Maybe there will be a pivot to government contracts. China is already positioning its AI ventures for ""sovereign independence "". In that case, why do they need a ton of people on earth if they have human-like robots to do everything they need?

So yeah, AI is being pushed to the masses now because mass adoption helps defray the costs while these guys try to get to AGI. But post AGI, they won't need us anymore.

1pd3672,changemyview,they are animals OR vermin OR subhuman OR cockroaches OR parasites,Zealot_TKO,cmv: It is irrational to dislike all AI-generated images,"What I mean by that is determining whether you think an image is AI-generated or not, and if it is, dismissing it as bad out-of-hand. 

Especially nowadays, AI-generated images have gotten good enough that many are nearly indistinguishable from real images (see the latest Will Smith image eating spaghetti). Even if one is able to distinguish an AI-generated image from other types, there is nothing inherent in the way that an image is generated that should make one like or dislike it; at the end of the day, an image should be judged by the image itself.

Hating on AI has simply become a culturally ""in"" thing to do, especially in certain online spaces (e.g. r/antiai among others), which I believe is the primary origination of AI-generated images getting so much hate (not the quality of the images themselves). The entire culture itself is irrational since AI is simply a tool that can be used for whatever purposes one wants; hating AI in general is akin to hating hammers (rather than people who use hammers for means you don't like while also acknowledging the positive ways they are used).

The only argument I see in favor of a blanket hatred towards AI-images is they will replace the work of many artists (drawers, photographers, etc). The reality, however, is much more nuanced. 

On the one hand, it certainly may replace a good chunk (or even all) of the work of these artists. The reality is more productive technologies have always done this and resisting it is futile. Either a technology is more productive than the thing its replacing and will be adopted, or it isn't more productive and will be discarded. If society continues to create and use AI-generated images in its content, it is because it is more productive (e.g. similar quality and more economical to create, or some combination thereof). Trying to resist AI-generated images on principle is akin to trying to resist Uber on the principle that taxicab drivers ought to be able to make a living

On the other hand, the ability to generate AI images empowers everyone who wants to create art, but don't have the raw skill to do so. Some will argue they aren't really creating art (the AI is), but I see it more like a gardener: while you don't control every pixel of the AI-generated image, you do control various aspects of it (via prompt engineering). In a similar way, gardeners control various aspects of the plant-growing process: water, sunlight, nutrient content, etc). Gardening is still a respectable skill and hobby despite only influencing the growth process of plants indirectly, so why isn't the same true of AI content generation?

In summary, despite it being culturally ""in"" to hate on AI image generation, it is irrational to hate on AI images simply because they are AI generated. AI images have gotten extremely realistic, and is a democratizing force for those who wish to create images but lack the raw drawing or graphics arts skills to do so the traditional way. Not only will AI images destroy the jobs of artists, it will enhance the productivity of artists, enabling them to create better quality and more art. And despite not physically creating the images ourselves, AI image generation shouldn't be any more frowned upon than gardening ( we indirectly help plants to grow).
